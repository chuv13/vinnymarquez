  Ah, time flies by so fast its already been two weeks since <a href="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/music/2013/4/10/interview-fidel-de-jesus" target="_self">my first interview</a>. For this session I&#8217;ve gone and interviewed a bassist. His name is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/misternobody.en" target="_blank">Roger Alcantara</a> AKA <a href="https://www.facebook.com/misternobody.en" target="_blank">Mister Nobody</a>. Bassist for Ebe Dancel, Eternal Now, Wickermoss and Barbie Almabis [sessions].
</div>

<div>
  I think I was in my early college days when I first encoutered Eternal Now. I was watching In the Raw on UNTV where they were featured. I loved the sound, the vocals and (if I remember correctly) the dude who wore a Jason Hockey Mask. Like <a href="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/music/2013/4/10/interview-fidel-de-jesus" target="_self">Fidel</a>, he&#8217;s also always on my facebook feed sharing music and (lately) telling people to eat broken glass. Lol. So without further adeu here is the interview in its entirety (I&#8217;ve done my best to translate it contextually):

      <strong>RA:</strong> I&#8217;m a very shy guy. hahahaha Especially towards people I meet for the first time. But after I warm up to you, medyo kalog <em>[tn: a little crazy]</em> and alaskador <i>[translation: someone who teases a person, sometimes in a very very annoying way. lol] </i>na. I&#8217;m brutally honest though. I don&#8217;t give a rats fig if you get offended&#8230; especially if what I&#8217;m saying is true. That&#8217;s just how I am&#8230; that&#8217;s why I get into trouble sometimes. But people who know me well enough accept that little quirk of mine, so I guess all is well.

      As for musical style, I can&#8217;t really limit it to a single style of music because I love &#8216;em all. hehehehe. I&#8217;m lucky enough to be able to work with bands and artists who play a wide variety of genres though, so I get to enjoy playing in different styles and forms of music.

      <strong>R:</strong> My bass teachers were Louis Ochoa and also The Beatles. They were the ones who turned me on to the bass, kaya sila talaga ang pinaka-malapit sa puso ko at mga tinuturing ko na mga main influences ko. Pero sa soundtrip&#8230; sobrang dami. The first albums i bought were The Rembrandts and Anthrax. hahahahaha sobrang layo pero ganun talaga kalawak trip ko nun. Trip na trip ko rin noon ang Pantera, Metallica, Suicidal Tendencies, Sepultura, Black Sabbath&#8230; tapos sa other end ng spectrum naman: Bryan Adams, Phil Collins, Gin Blossoms, Counting Crows, Sting, Duran Duran, etc etc etc.

      Later on na ako talaga nagsimulang mag research ng mga bassists. Sina Jaco Pastorius, Pino Palladino, Lee Sklar, Michael Manring, tapos na-discover ko na sina Les Claypool, Geddy Lee, and Tony Levin &#8212; nagsimula na ako ma-hook sa prog around this time without me knowing that it was called prog. Trip na trip ko lang yung mga explorations nila ng ideas. Around this time ko rin na-meet sina Pepe and the rest of Eternal Now.

      Sa local scene naman, sobrang favorite ko Barbie&#8217;s Cradle. Isa sa mga major influences ko si Rommel dela Cruz and he continues to inspre me to this day. Siguro 70% ng ginagawa ko ngayon inspired by Rommel&#8217;s lines and ideas. Whenever I write bass lines for songs palaging naka &#8220;What would Rommel do?&#8221; mode ako. Sobrang galing lang talaga niya gumawa ng storya sa bass. Isa pa si Karel Honasan. Sobrang inspiring ng pagiging adventurous niya sa bass. Hindi ko actually magawa mga nagagawa niya sa bass hahahaha Pero sobrang inspiring yung drive niya to take the bass to a different level. That takes a lot of courage&#8230; sobrang nakakahawa and inspiring. Ang dami ko natututunan sa kanya. Pero ang pinaka-importante talaga &#8212; sobrang bait at humble ng dalawang mamang to. In the end, yun talaga pinaka-importante. Nothing&#8217;s more awesome than finding out that the heroes you look up to are such magnificent human beings. Mas lalo kang ma-iinspire.

Mag isang kumakanta yung bass na yun. Kung kaya ko nga lang mag fretless na lang exclusively, yun na magiging main bass ko eh. hehehehe Yung Hofner Beatle Bass naman, medyo may connection kasi sa kabataan ko. I&#8217;m a huuuuuge Beatlemaniac. Iba pa rin talaga yung dating sakin nung vintage woofy thump nung Hofner. Masaya lang ako na nasa stable ko na yung dream bass ko.

Nakatulong din to sa development ko siguro as a bassist. Last resort ko na talaga yung tabs pag talagang naipit na ako sa isang part. So di ko rin talaga ramdam yung &#8220;advantage&#8221; ng internet nowadays kasi kung tipong may internet na nung panahon ko, di pa rin siguro ako maghahanap ng tabs or youtube vids. Tamang malamig na sahig na pwedeng upuan, cheese curls, at mainit na kape para sa puyatang kapaan sessions lang kailangan ko &#8212; tsaka tape player na may maayos na head. hahahahaha

So I really don't feel the advantage of having the internet nowadays because if I think if I had internet back then I still wouldn't look for tabs or youtube videos.

      Pag dating sa gear naman, mas pinadali na halos lahat &#8212; yung paglikha na lang ng musika ang kailangan mo atupagin. Who would&#8217;ve thought na pwede ka mag-record ng kanta using your phone? Never ko na-imagine na mangyayari yun nung nagsisimula pa lang ako. Everything is easier nowadays. These things, although di na natin napapansin talaga, have a huge impact sa creative process of making music.

      Ang laking tulong rin talaga ng Social Media sa musicians. Dati pag gumawa ka ng demo, kayo kayo lang ng mga tropa mo at mga uncle at auntie mo ang makakarinig nun. Ngayon post mo lang sa Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, o Soundcloud ang dami na makakarinig nun. As musicians importante na alam nating may nakikinig ng likha natin. We should really take advantage of Social Media&#8217;s networking capabilities. It doesn&#8217;t really matter kung may 1 million listeners/viewers ka o tatlo lang. Basta&#8217;t may nakikinig &#8212; yun ang importante. Basta may nakikinig, mag kwento ka lang.

It doesn't really matter if you have 1 million listeners/viewers or just 3. As long as other people will listen --- Thats what counts. As long as someone is listening, just keep on telling stories.]</i>

      <b>Are you optimistic for the future of music?</b>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <b>R:</b> Lagi ako excited para sa music. Maaaring di ko trip yung mga ibang lumalabas, pero palagi ako excited sa kung ano pang maaaring lumabas. I guess that&#8217;s how it is when you are really passionate about something. Maaaring pabago bago ang trend, pero parati namang may lumalabas na makakapag-pasayaw sayo&#8230; makakapag-paiyak. Baka nga yung next John Mayer asa banyo ngayon at hinuhugasan pa yung pwet ng yaya niya. O yung susunod na Jaco, nangangamote pa sa multiplication ngayon. hahahahaha I guess what I&#8217;m trying to say is&#8230; Music is forever. Basta&#8217;t may kumakanta at nakikinig, the future will always be awesome.

Maybe the next John Mayer is still inside the bathroom today, his bum still being washed by his nanny. Or maybe the next Jaco, currently struggling with his multiplication. hahahahaha I guess what I'm trying to say is... Music is forever. As long as someone is still singing and listening, the future will always be awesome.]</i>

      <b>Thoughts on the local music scene?</b>

      <b>R:</b> It&#8217;s alive and well. Ang daming magaling na manunulat at musiko ngayon. Don&#8217;t listen to naysayers who rely on stats, sales, etc. Music goes beyond those superficial things. The business side is just one part of it&#8230; the other side is more important and more relevant &#8212; the art. Basta may tumutugtog at may nakikinag, manantiling buhay ang musika. Pero syempre we have to do our part din to help keep it alive. Buy albums. Go to gigs. Ang sarap makinig at tumugtog ng musika. Heto na ata ang pinaka-mismong bisyo.

      <b>R:</b> Nakuha ko na actually &#8212; yung DLC Fretless ko. Traditional designs ang gusto ko eh so I&#8217;m not very hard to please. Usually mga jazz/precision bass type bodies. I&#8217;m also not fond of exotic tops&#8230; tamang alder or ash lang na body oks na ako. Sa finish&#8230; dun medyo maarte ako. hahahahah Malamang Antigua ulit or Tobacco Burst. Electronics naman passive lang rin. Medyo boring eh no? heheheheh pero heto na kasi nakasanayan ko so yun mga pinaka-comfy ako tugtugin.
