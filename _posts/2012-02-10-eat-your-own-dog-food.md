<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food" target="_blank">Eat your own dog food or dogfooding</a>� basically means to &#8216;use your own products&#8217;. So thats basically what I wanted to achieve when I developed this website from the ground up. I asked myself &#8220;I&#8217;m a .net dev so why should I use a blogging service if I can create my own?&#8221;. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t have something against using a blogging service, there are a lot of excellent blogging services out there. It&#8217;s just that I figured I would&#8217;nt want to use any of them for something that represents me as a software developer. Plus the fact that I wanted full control over my web playground (or atleast how it looks and works). <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

I realized that there are pros and cons with coding your own website. For me the most positive thing out of this experience is being able to practice my skills a little closer to home (away from work), and the biggest con would be integrating or implementing everything yourself. For example, this website started out as my learning tool for� <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3" target="_blank">ASP .net MVC</a>� which then turned to a full blown site/blog/portfolio. When that went into motion things just started popping up in my head (what features to include and NOT to include) which either gave me extreme happiness or a mild-painfully excruciating headache (lol. sorry for being so dramatic). But the cool thing is I get to hand pick every solution for every problem I encounter resulting intto software totally embodying what I wanted to achieve.

So now I&#8217;m really motivated to someday (meaning maybe this week or next week) launch a series of articles on constructing a website from scratch using� <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3" target="_blank">ASP .net MVC</a>� or maybe put up articles about solutions to certain problems. It&#8217;s not final yet but the idea is already swimming around my head. One thing I know though is that I&#8217;m going to name the series &#8220;dogfooding&#8221;. Thats if I successfully pull it off. Lol.

Anyways, I have to go. I got a basketball game to attend to (one of the perks of a guy working for� <a href="http://www.rivereo.com/" target="_blank">Rivereo Inc.</a>). See ya!
