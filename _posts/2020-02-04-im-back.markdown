It's been almost two years (I think) since I've left blogging and social media as a whole. The time without social media has granted me the much needed rest. Now, I come back with a fresh new IDGAF mindset nad it's freakin' good! Thanks to the influence of Rick and Morty, Chuck Palhaniuk, Albet Camus, and "The Subtle art of not giving a fuck" by Mark Manson.

Although I didn't really want to come back, I really had to; part due to some projects I've been working on ([Henlo, Chimkin!](https://www.facebook.com/henlochimkin), [Tito Science](https://www.facebook.com/titoscience/), and now [CHVCK](https://www.facebook.com/chvckofficial)) and part because I feel that my mindset has now accepted social media as what it is... soooooo sh*tposting just became super fun IMHO.

Oh well, time for some updates then!

## TITO SCIENCE

Unfornatunately, we're still on hiatus. Most the band members have a lot of adulting issues that still needs to be taken care of. Our songs are just sitting on the corners of our hard drives waiting to be recorded (and released, of course). We've been trying and failing to setup our practice/drinking sessions for months now. I honestly haven't practiced in a while.

But all in all, we're good! Almost all of us have been married. Apparently I'm going to be the last one to tie the knot. Two of our members had brand spanking new kids! At the end of the day, we're still the same weekend titos. Just a bit rusty on the musical side.

## CHVCK

ChuBoy (Tito Science's keyboardist) and I talked a lot about making a Trip-Hop duo for a few years now. So since we're not doing anything with TS, we started an electronic duo named [CHVCK](https://www.facebook.com/chvckofficial). I don't have any material for you guys yet, but we'll post stuff as soon as we iron things out.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/assets/blog/posts/im-back-op-z-vt-4.jpg" title="New Gear" caption="I made the only sane decision. GAS mode on: Teenage Engineering OP-Z, Roland VT-4. Imported from AU by my loveable Lil' Bro HAHA" %}

So auditing my 2020 setup, it would sort of look like this...

Desktop:
- Gaming PC that's going to be converted to a *Hackintosh*, maybe
- A borrowed *Novation LaunchPad Pro* (thanks, Jedi)
- My old Behringer *Xenyx302 USB*
- My previous boss sold me a *Gretsch Rancher*
- My 2019 acquired *Greg Bennet* PRS looking thingie
- I also could't find my *AT2020* so I got a *MXL 770* to replace that cheapo *BM-800* that I currently use (thanks, MotMot).
  
Live:
- My old *Arturia Minilab MKII* (with a broken key that I plan to fix later)
- The teeny tiny *Teenage Engineering OP-Z* with an Oplab module
- The powerful vocoder, *Roland VT-4*

The only thing missing for my setup would be studio monitors, a *Mackie CR3* maybe? The cheapest one that I can get.


<!-- You’ll find this post in your *_posts* directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run *jekyll serve*, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

*YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP*

Where *YEAR* is a four-digit number, *MONTH* and *DAY* are both two-digit numbers, and *MARKUP* is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
