The Philippines&#8217; undisputed King of Comedy passed away today at age 83. He was admitted at Makati Medical Center on July 6, 2012 after complaining of shortage of breath. He showed signs of recovery but was readmitted due to reccuring signs of pneumonia.

I grew up watching his TV shows and Movies. Thank you sir for blessing us with laughter. You will be missed.

On another side of the story, vandals have been trolling with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphy" target="_blank">Dolphy&#8217;s Wikipedia page</a>ï¿½ modifying the page with content ranging from slight pranks to obscene stuff. Seriously? Someone just died. The internet is not a playground where anyone can behave immaturely without consequences. There are real people behind those browsers. Tsk. Disappointing.
