  One of the problems I face when it comes to file storage is the file system. I am a .net developer so I use a PC at work but my personal machine is a Mac. My head has been aching with file storage: Macs can&#8217;t write (read-only) to NTFS formatted drives and PCs can&#8217;t read Journaled disks. I&#8217;ve tried using macreader and ntfs-3g with mixed results (think corrupted files). Last year I planned to build my own NAS using a Raspberry Pi but couldn&#8217;t finish the project.

I recently acquired a 4TB My Book Live Duo from an<a href="http://raniel.net" target="_blank"> undisclosed friend</a>, who sold it to me at a great price. Its kind of your (it is marketed as your) personal cloud. Its a NAS connected through the network. So it won&#8217;t matter if I access it from a Mac or a PC. Its plug and play and all of it contained in a small black box around half the size of a woman&#8217;s shoe box.

    <b>Real World Use</b>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <i>Using a Mac/</i><i>PC</i>
</div>

<div>
  I haven&#8217;t encountered problems using this at home using either OSX or Wind8 (VM for now, not testing using dual boot). At times I forget to shut it down via the WD Quick View utility but it still runs fine. Read and write speeds are dependent on network connection though (I use an old router to its adequate but a little slow). Using it in the office is a different story though, I tried once but never got it to work through our network. A colleague of mine uses a personal router to connect her MyBook Live.

<div>
  <i>Using the iOS App</i>
</div>

<div>
  I have already tried accessing the server on my iPad by using the WD 2Go app (free). Down side to this though is the app actually downloads the selected content first before you will be able to view/use the file (I tried to watch a movie and it proceeded downloaded the whole 1+gb). I also tried accessing it from the outside and it works like a charm, very dependent on internet speed though.

<div>
  <i>Using the RikoMagic MK802</i>
</div>

<div>
  This holy week I visited our ancestral home and it turns out my mom bought a new tv (a samsung series 3 I think and they didn&#8217;t buy the optional wi-fi dongle. boo). The Cable TV company in the area did not have HD channels so , watching HBO hurt my eyes. For watching movies the family relied on movies downloaded to usb sticks. In an effort to simplify the process I tried using my RikoMagic MK802 (an Android Mini PC) that I connected to the TV using an HDMI cable, access the server and watch movies. It was a good idea, in theory but the mini pc kept hanging therefore we were unable to watch for more than 15 mins. Bummer.

  <b>Conclusion</b>
</div>

<div>
  I love it! Its dependable, flexible and is exactly what I need. If you are looking for a easy to setup and use NAS, this is the one for you!
