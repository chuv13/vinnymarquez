<span class="dropcap1">A</span>n <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/9-reasons-your-current-resume-will-never-get-you-a-job-at-apple-or-google-2012-2?op=1" target="_blank">article I recently read</a> listed 9 reasons why my resume will never get me a job in Apple or Google (I qualify in 5/9 of those reasons. LOL). Not that I am currently applying for Apple or google, its just that I want to keep up with the times and ofcourse it feels fulfilling to be equipped/proficient with skills that are hot in the market right now. So I upgraded my resume and created <a href="http://re.vu/johnvinnymarquez" target="_blank">a re.vu account to serve as a portal/resume</a> as part of my inititive to move forward.

You can download my resume in both <a href="../../download/resumepdf" target="_blank">pdf</a> and [zip][1] format.

I recently understood that my career in software development is not just centered around work, there has to be some level of social/networking activities that I should be doing in order to promote my skills. Everything is social nowadays (in our office we have such a thing as social cooking.LOL). With that in mind I decided to (rebrand myself?) tidy up my online accounts and make them more professional. I also have been busy trying to either sharpen up my current skills or revive old ones in which I thought would&#8217;ve already rusted. This website is just a part of a big plan to restructure my personal/professional life.

Watch out for the next phase! :p
