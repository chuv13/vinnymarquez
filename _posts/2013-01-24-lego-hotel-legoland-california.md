I am a big fan of Lego. I had lots of sets when I was young (courtesy of my godmother from Germany) and I had fun building and destroying stuff. I attribute my thinking skills to these toys. Unfortunately, I was not a good steward when it came to toys so what&#8217;s left is a small container and my recently acquired Shell / Ferrari / Lego promo set. Someday, I&#8217;m going to start collecting again!

When I was young, my dream was to go to LEGOLAND Germany, so staying at a Lego hotel like this would make me the happiest big kid ever!
