Have you ever found yourself in a situation wherein you absolutely had to get something done but you catch yourself periodically checking Facebook? Do you feel the urge to always check on your new feed with the thought of finding something interesting? Well, I feel that way most of the time and it’s become a bit unhealthy for my brain. The first thought I usually have when I want to escape the daily grind is to scan the posts in my Facebook feed, watch videos on youtube or read manga. Since I’ve been trying to fix broken parts of my life, I thought that I would have to deal with this habit. The best solution I can think of? **Unfollow most of my 1k+ friends and subscriptions, curate my friends list regularly (leave only friends whom I’ve really associated with) and use a Facebook chat tool for communication**. Why would I do that?&#8230;

### UNFOLLOW MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS

I’ve read somewhere that our use of social media has to be intentional. We can use it to grow our businesses, widen our influence and help us engage more people. One thing that can be a potential problem with this is the ease of adding more and more friends. Did you know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number" target="_blank">you can only maintain a healthy relationship with only 150 friends at a time</a>? If your Facebook friends number more than that, then you’re not actually having meaningful or regular relationships with the rest. Lets face it, you can't be aware of what everyone's doing. If you are then you might be consuming much of your time devouring every item in your news feed. Been there, done that. I had to do something about it.

The first thing that actually came into my head was to unfriend people. As I was about to start, I realized that **ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE REALLY MY FRIENDS! I CAN’T JUST UNFRIEND THEM!** It’s true, at some point I spent time with each and everyone of these people. **THEY ARE FRIENDS!** On the down side though, most of their posts are distant, un-interesting (at the moment because of the distance) and irrelevant to my life. I then understood that I should keep them in my friends list, but I had no need to follow their posts. Last night, I un-followed about 80+% of my friends. I've been testing out my feed and yep, I think it's working. I don’t have the urge anymore to keep looking at my feed, because the rate of me finding new and &#8216;interesting' posts isn’t as fast as it used to be. Lately, I find that it takes less than 5mins to sift through all of the posts if I check� around three to five times a day.

You don't have to feel bad, people can still tag you, post to your wall and message you. Whenever they do that then you can decide if you want to follow their posts again. Feed problem solved!

### ACTIVELY CURATE YOUR FRIENDS LIST

Add only those whom you have associated with, delete unknowns and don't accept invitations from strangers. Snobbish? I don't think so, but it's entirely up to you. You can add up as many as you want provided that you **still curate who you follow**.

What was that? You have fans? Create a fan page then.

### GET A FACEBOOK CHAT APP

I usually miss private messages because I used to stop myself from using Facebook. But now that the feed problem has been addressed I want to be able to talk to my friends again without having to spend much time accessing FB. � What I did is I picked an app that would allow me to use** just the chat functionality of Facebook**. Here are some of my recommendations (*I'm a mac user so most of these are mac only*):

1. **Use iChat/Messenger**. Did you know that you can use it for FB chat? Go to Messenger > Preferences > Add Account&#8230;

2. Use 3rd party apps like **<a href="http://astroim.com/#/hero" target="_blank">Astro</a>� **and<a href="http://flamingo.im/" target="_blank"><strong>Flamingo</strong></a>. These will make your life easier.

  <img class="size-full wp-image-1310" alt="Oh hai there Tophie!" src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/messages.png" width="796" height="529" /></a>
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

  </p>
</div>

3. You can use <a href="http://www.skype.com/‎" target="_blank">Skype</a>. Just add FB integration and you're good to go. Bad news though, you can views FB conversations that you didn't do in it.

### CONCLUSION

It's been very effective for me. I haven't been distracted by an FB tab in my browser and I've been more intentional with my FB use. I sure hope it works for you too!
