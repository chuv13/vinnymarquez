<span class="dropcap1">I</span>&#8216;ve been slowly building my recording equipment since last year. Here are the latest addition to my gear is a guitar customized (<a title="Tesla" href="http://www.teslapickups.com/" target="_blank">Tesla</a> pickups, treble bleed mod) by Neil (<a title="sixdayoldstring" href="http://www.myspace.com/sixdayoldstring" target="_blank">sixdayoldstring</a>), a <a title="Marshal MG15CDR" href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/guitar_amplifiers/marshall/mg15cdr/index.html" target="_blank">Marshall MG15CDR</a> c/o Jopoy and a <a title="Stage Stands Pop Filter" href="http://themusicsource.ph/content/stage-asvs-gb-6" target="_blank">Stage Stands Pop Filter</a> c/o manong Chard. All I have left to procure is a mic stand so that I can mount my DIY shock mount (the build log in the future will be posted on my works section).

Now I want to move on to soundproofing and tuning a spare room in our house. I&#8217;m finding this a very hard problem to tackle.  I think I&#8217;ll go with a room within a room approach then maybe a separate soundbooth. Maybe. So I guess for now I will be digging around the web for knowledge while carefully thinking this through. As much as possible I want this project to be DIY.
