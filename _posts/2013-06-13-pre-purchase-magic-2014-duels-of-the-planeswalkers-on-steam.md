I owned the 2013 version on iPad (which was a blast to play but a annoying without the iCloud integration for game state) and now the 2014 version is almost here! I love my iPad and using it for gaming, reading, watching etc. but lately I&#8217;ve been using more of my laptop (because of all the skills I&#8217;m &#8220;refining&#8221;) and pretty much leave it in my bag most of the time. So my laptop is pretty much WORK X PLAY territory now. Anyway, take a look at this:

> ## Pre-Purchase Offer
> 
> Pre-purchase Magic 2014 – Duels of the Planeswalkers (regular or Special Editions) and receive access to the Chandra’s “Firewave” Deck.

Well, its a nice freebie. Unlocking decks in this game means defeating enemies and winning cards to complete decks. You can pay another $9.99 dollars to unlock decks so technically, you will save $9.99 dollars by pre-purchasing. Also take a look at another promo:

> ## Special Edition
> 
> The Special Edition includes the following:
> 
> *   Magic: The Gathering 2014 &#8211; Duels of the Planeswalkers Base Game
> *   Soundtrack: Planar themes and the licensed I Fight Dragons song as MP3s
> *   Wallpapers: 5 desktop wallpapers; in multiple sizes
> *   eBook: “Return To Ravnica” novella in PDF format
> *   10x Foil Conversions. Early access to foiled cards for the 10 Base game decks

For those who are uninitiated to the game:
