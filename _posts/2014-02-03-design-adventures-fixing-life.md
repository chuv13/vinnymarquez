For the first blog post for the year (after much thought and deliberation), I decided to write about my decision to learn how to design. From this point on, I&#8217;m dedicating this blog to capture the events, changes, learning and tools that I will encounter on my journey. It doesn’t mean that I’ll stop being a programmer. It just really want to learn how to design and that I&#8217;m finally driving my career the way I want to. I&#8217;m going to focus on solving and building things for myself as practice.

I believe that having a technical skill is very important in building things. Having some programming chops will be beneficial to me, but I will have to do a lot of learning from a variety of different fields. Much of my time is now dedicated to reading books on design (or pretty much everything I can get my hands on with regards to building things), business and processes.

I have to admit, I have been very unorganized until now and that I have had so many broken processes in my life that need to be addressed. That&#8217;s why it will be my first big project: Fixing my life.

I made this list that I will be referring to as my backlog. It will be updated everytime I accomplish something, or think of something new.
