<span class="dropcap1">T</span>hank God for my girlfriend Mawie who takes her time to look at groupon-like sites! Because of her we got to see Drum Tao perform at the <a title="Theater" href="http://www.rwmanila.com/entertainment-at-resorts-world-manila/newport-performing-arts-theater/" target="_blank">Resorts World Manila: Performing Arts Theater</a> last July 20, 2012 (They will be here in manila up to July 22, 2012 and then will fly to Cebu). We purchased discounted Deluxe Tickets from <a title="Drum Tao Ensogo" href="http://www.ensogo.com.ph/manila/drum-tao-07172012.html" target="_blank">Ensogo</a>.

<a title="Drum Tao" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_(musical_troupe)" target="_blank">Drum Tao</a> (Tao means Way/Road) is a musical troupe from Japan focusing on drum and dance refelcting traditional Japanese culture (though they also incorporate other musical styles like Maori, Indonesian and Korean). It is said that their daily routine starts from 5AM to 10PM and includes a 20km run, calisthenics, martial arts training and hours of drumming and dancing.

I have been an otaku for as long as I can remember. I have always loved Japanese culture and was involved in a <a title="Laruku" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Arc-en-Ciel" target="_blank">L&#8217;arc~en~Ciel</a> cover band so attending the event took me closer to Japan than I&#8217;ve ever been. Before the main event, they had a little show at the Resort&#8217;s World plaza. We just finished eating near the stage so we quickly grabbed 2 seats near the stage. It was awesome! Too bad I got shy (they were sooooooooo cool so I got really really shy. lol. Yes, I am weird) and refused to approach them to have my picture taken (refusing even the playful prodding of Mawie, she knew I wanted a picture). Next time, I won&#8217;t hesitate!

Anyways, onto the show. Cameras weren&#8217;t allowed inside the theatre (copyright purposes) so the only snaps we had were from the mini show outside. So you&#8217;ll just have to read about them or maybe google for some performance pics. For me, these are the highlights:

**Discipline and Artistry**

Their artistry and the way they perform to me is much like organized chaos, similar to how you execute a jumping spinning roundhouse. The first thing I noticed about them is how they embody the discipline of the Japanese people. Everywhere in the performance you can see the disipline akin to that of the tea ceremony. Whenever they hit their drums, each hit is coordinated with other bodily movements like swaying hips, rotating the heavy sticks before hitting the drums in cadence. Even in the changing of their beaters they do not rush, its like they&#8217;re continously counting and every action including shifting between beaters are included. I was also in awe of the multi-disciplinary nature of the performers, the kind of performer I would like to be. Lol. They play music, they have good stamina, timing, stage prescence, they can dance, do martial arts and even act.

**Instrumentation**

They brought an arsenal of <a title="Taiko" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko" target="_blank">Taiko</a> drums thundering the stage with war like magnitude, seranaded us with the cool sound of the <a title="Shinobue" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinobue" target="_blank">Shinobue</a>, almost made me cry with the <a title="Koto" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koto_(musical_instrument)" target="_blank">Koto</a>(lol), tickled us with the playful Bamboo <a title="Marimba" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marimbas" target="_blank">Marimba</a> and rocked us with the <a title="Shamisen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamisen" target="_blank">Shamisen</a>. This is easily the best show I&#8217;ve ever gone to!

**Martial Arts**

I was mesmerized of this one performer that takes center stage using a <a title="Bo Staff" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C5%8D" target="_blank">Bo Staff</a> (sometimes 2 staves), he twirls them with ease I was giggling like a school girl!

**Dancing**

Well, dancing is almost synonymous to Martial Arts. There are a lot of martial arts that were hidden within dance so that they would not be lost. And in they easily pull it off too, even while carrying large Taiko drums! Talk about musculature! Even the girls have more toned muscles than me&#8230; That made me a little sad.

**Audience Impact/Participation**

I think this is where they really shine. They require the audience to participate in their numbers. A few times they asked us to be metronomes by clapping, other times they&#8217;d play some drum patters and asked us to respond by copying it. I was really fun. There were 2 kids (girls) behind us and they were laughing most of the time (though sometimes they were a little annoying when it came to solemn parts). We knew we experienced something special so the whole auditorium responded with standing ovations (2 times!). The little girlies even screamed their lungs off for <a title="Hiroaki Kishino" href="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3067/2576493501_474d36707f_z.jpg" target="_blank">Hiroaki Kishino</a> at his curtain call. Maybe its because he looks like <a title="Shun Oguri" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_GEsNEVBp-ho/Slh0KGgtSgI/AAAAAAAABNM/oJFmwAyAaU8/s400/Oguri+Shun.jpg" target="_blank">Shun Oguri</a> on steroids (<a title="Crows Zero" href="http://asiabeam.com.nyud.net/v/var/albums/movies/Crows_Zero_2/Crows%20Zero%202%20image%2010.jpg" target="_blank">in Crows Zero</a>).

**\*Spoiler alert\*** A funny moment at the end of the show: <a title="Yoshinori Suito" href="http://u1.ipernity.com/5/47/79/1864779.eb8fae83.560.jpg" target="_blank">Yoshinori Suito</a> goes up on stage with a piece of paper in his hand and tells us he has something important to say. He then says that outside the auditorium are boxes of CDs and DVDs, they don&#8217;t want to take them back home so we should by them. Even with all the plugging, he&#8217;s still funny.

If your curiousity has been piqued, here&#8217;s a visual teaser:



We had so much fun that we became fans on the spot and bought their 2010 Ethereal Beats DVD (or maybe it was just inception from Yoshi)! When they come back here I won&#8217;t hesitate to buy VIP tickets!
