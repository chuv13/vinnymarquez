Mawie recently bought this uber small form factor camera (roughly the size of 2 five Philippine perso coins together). It boasts 5.0MP with a 1280 x 960 resolution, 50MB internal memory, MicroSD slot and re-chargeable via usb. Package contains the camera, a mini usb to usb connector, 3.5mm jack to mini usb connector, keyring flash/portable battery module (needs 1 AA battery and powers the camera through 3.5mm to mini usb) and a wrist strap. Mawie bought it discounted from <a title="http://www.ensogo.com.ph/" href="http://www.ensogo.com.ph/" target="_blank">Ensogo</a> at 799PHP (original price of 1,500PHP).

  It&#8217;s performance when it comes to stills is kind of mediocre but for video I think its a winner considering the size and cost. It doesn&#8217;t perform well with lowlight though but so what? <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Besides it being a portable video recorder it also doubles as a webcam when plugged to a pc. Oh and did I mention already that it records audio as well? Nice.
