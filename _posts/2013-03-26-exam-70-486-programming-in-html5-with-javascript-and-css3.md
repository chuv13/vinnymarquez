I passed the Exam 70-486: Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3 today!� � This is the initial exam for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/mcsd-web-apps-certification.aspx#fbid=hQ0DLAr3XSS" target="_blank">MCSD: Web Applications Solutions Develope</a>r. This is the first time that I&#8217;ve wanted to finish a whole track, I&#8217;ve always been an MCTS since forever lol. I&#8217;m starting to transition to Web Development again (since Silverlight is a dead end technology, but atleast my XAML and prototyping skills will still be of use) this year by taking on personal projects and taking trainings and certifications. I sure hope I can cram all that into whatever time I have left right now.

How about you guys? Which tracks are you interested in? Have any of you updated your certifications already?
