One of the most exciting news I&#8217;ve heard so far is the announcement of the new<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS/" target="_blank"> SteamOS: a living room OS built by Steam and is based on Linux</a>. Valve announced the development of  <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamMachines/" target="_blank">&#8220;Steam Machines&#8221;</a> and the upcoming beta testing stage.  
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamMachines/" target="_blank">Steam Machines</a> are machines that will run the SteamOS, with customizable hardware and will be released in 2014.

> A powerful new category of living-room hardware is on the horizon.  
> Join the hardware beta now.  
> Choose the model right for you in 2014

### How to be a part of the beta

After completing the steps, the badge will appear on your account (+150XP) and you will have a chance to be one of the 300 beta testers. Take a look at the badge quest below:

### Questions

Here are some of the questions found in the article that I found interesting:

> #### How will you choose the 300 beta participants?
> A small number of users (30 or less) will be chosen based on their past community contributions and beta participation. The  remainder will be chosen at random from the eligible pool.
> 
> #### When will the prototypes ship? 
> This year.
> 
> #### Will beta testers be allowed to share info about their experience and post pictures and opinions online?
> Yes, that really is the whole point. The input from testers should come in many forms: bug reports, forum posts, concept art, 3D prints, haikus, and also very publicly stated opinions.
> 
> #### Can I hack this box? Run another OS? Change the hardware? Install my own software? Use it to build a robot?
> Sure.
> 
> #### Can I download the OS to try it out?
> You will be able to download it (including the source code, if you&#8217;re into that) but not yet.
> 
> #### What games will be available during the beta?
> The nearly 3,000 games on Steam. Hundreds already running natively on the SteamOS, with more to come. The rest will work seamlessly via in-home streaming.
>     
> #### What is SteamOS? Whatâ€™s included?
> Here&#8217;s <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS">a link to what we said earlier about SteamOS</a>. We&#8217;ll have more details to tell you, soon.
   

### Conclusion
 
I would love to be part of the beta and receive one of those steam machines. Hack it, run another OS, install my own software, or use it to build a robot aside from being able to play games on it? Count me in!
