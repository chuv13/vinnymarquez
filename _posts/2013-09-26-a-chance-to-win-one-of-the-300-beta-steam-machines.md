One of the most exciting news I&#8217;ve heard so far is the announcement of the new<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS/" target="_blank"> SteamOS: a living room OS built by Steam and is based on Linux</a>. Valve announced the development of  <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamMachines/" target="_blank">&#8220;Steam Machines&#8221;</a> and the upcoming beta testing stage.  
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamMachines/" target="_blank">Steam Machines</a> are machines that will run the SteamOS, with customizable hardware and will be released in 2014.

> A powerful new category of living-room hardware is on the horizon.  
> Join the hardware beta now.  
> Choose the model right for you in 2014

**How to be a part of the beta:**

After completing the steps, the badge will appear on your account (+150XP) and you will have a chance to be one of the 300 beta testers. Take a look at the badge quest below:

**Questions**

Here are some of the questions found in the article that I found interesting:

***How will you choose the 300 beta participants?***  
******A small number of users (30 or less) will be chosen based on their past community contributions and beta participation. The remainder will be chosen at random from the eligible pool.

<div>
  <strong>When will the prototypes ship?</strong>
</div>

<div>
  <strong></strong>This year.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <strong>Will beta testers be allowed to share info about their experience and post pictures and opinions online?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <div>
    Yes, that really is the whole point. The input from testers should come in many forms: bug reports, forum posts, concept art, 3D prints, haikus, and also very publicly stated opinions.
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>Can I hack this box? Run another OS? Change the hardware? Install my own software? Use it to build a robot?</strong>
    </p>
    
    <div>
      Sure.
    </div>
    
    <div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <p>
        <strong>Can I download the OS to try it out?</strong>
      </p>
      
      <div>
        You will be able to download it (including the source code, if you&#8217;re into that) but not yet.
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <div>
        <strong>What games will be available during the beta?</strong>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        The nearly 3,000 games on Steam. Hundreds already running natively on the SteamOS, with more to come. The rest will work seamlessly via in-home streaming.

          <strong>What is SteamOS? Whatâ€™s included?</strong>

        <div>
          Here&#8217;s <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS">a link to what we said earlier about SteamOS</a>. We&#8217;ll have more details to tell you, soon.

**Conclusion**

I would love to be part of the beta and receive one of those steam machines. Hack it, run another OS, install my own software, or use it to build a robot aside from being able to play games on it?
