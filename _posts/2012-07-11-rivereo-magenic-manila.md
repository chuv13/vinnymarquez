Here we go! After a few months of being hush hush about this topic, we have been officially allowed to let the whole world know! Lol.

<a href="http://www.rivereo.com/" target="_blank">Rivereo</a>, the company I&#8217;ve been with for almost 2 years now has been acquired by <a title="Magenic" href="http://magenic.com/" target="_blank">Magenic</a> (think <a href="http://lhotka.net/" target="_blank">Rocky Lohtka</a>/<a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/" target="_blank">CSLA .net</a>) as a subsidiary and will be renamed as &#8220;Magenic Manila&#8221;. So don&#8217;t be surprised if you see me posting <a href="http://recruiting.jobvite.com/" target="_blank">Jobvites</a> for Magenic on my Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin accounts.
