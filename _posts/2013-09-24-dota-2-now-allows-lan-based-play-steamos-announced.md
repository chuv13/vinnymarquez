Finally! The latest <a href="http://www.dota2.com/firstblood" target="_blank">DoTA 2 update (First Blood)</a>� now features local (LAN based) play, and is available now for download.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

The most notable changes (for me) would be:

*   **Local play! Local play! Local play! (will it be easier for people to stop playing on WC3 now?)**

<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Local servers <strong>allows players on the same physical network to connect to a locally hosted game</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      By selecting &#8220;Create Local Lobby&#8221;, the leader of the lobby will become the host for a match by running a local server
    </li>
    <li>
      Players can see Local lobbies available on their physical network by going to &#8220;FIND A LOBBY&#8221; and selecting the &#8220;LOCAL LOBBIES&#8221; tab
    </li>
    <li>
      Local Lobbies follow the same rules as Private Lobbies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Upon completion of the Local game, the replay will be stored on the lobby leader&#8217;s computer in replays/<match-id>.dem
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

*   ******Improved Armory. You can now build filters for, and navigate your armory by item type, quality, rarity and more.**
*   ******Upgraded Items can always be disassembled within 10 seconds of the combine (same rules as sell back)**
*   ******Item purchases can be made at the secret shop if the courier is at that location without selecting the courier**
*   ******Pudge: Meat Hook now pulls the target to the initial hook position regardless of where Pudge is (no more foutain and force staff hooks! yey! :p)**
*   ******Control groups are now saved to the cloud, per hero, and will persist across games and disconnects. They are saved per hero.**
*   ******Alt-left clicking on an enemy icon in the top bar will send a chat message that the hero is missing**
*   ******Beginning soon, users will be suspended from Dota 2 for 30 days when external tools attached to Dota 2 are detected by the Valve Anti-Cheat system.**
*   ******The quality of the item drops you are eligible for is now tied to your Dota profile level. You can see your current drop level in your profile page.**

Now the only thing missing is Phoenix, my favourite hero. <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />
