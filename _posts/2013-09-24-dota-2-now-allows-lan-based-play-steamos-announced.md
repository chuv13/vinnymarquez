Finally! The latest <a href="http://www.dota2.com/firstblood" target="_blank">DoTA 2 update (First Blood)</a> now features local (LAN based) play, and is available now for download.

The most notable changes (for me) would be:

* Local play! Local play! Local play! (will it be easier for people to stop playing on WC3 now?)
* Local servers <strong>allows players on the same physical network to connect to a locally hosted game</strong>
* By selecting &#8220;Create Local Lobby&#8221;, the leader of the lobby will become the host for a match by running a local server
* Players can see Local lobbies available on their physical network by going to &#8220;FIND A LOBBY&#8221; and selecting the &#8220;LOCAL LOBBIES&#8221; tab
* Local Lobbies follow the same rules as Private Lobbies.
* Upon completion of the Local game, the replay will be stored on the lobby leader&#8217;s computer in replays/<match-id>.
  + Improved Armory. You can now build filters for, and navigate your armory by item type, quality, rarity and more.**
  + Upgraded Items can always be disassembled within 10 seconds of the combine (same rules as sell back)**
  + Item purchases can be made at the secret shop if the courier is at that location without selecting the courier**
  + Pudge: Meat Hook now pulls the target to the initial hook position regardless of where Pudge is (no more foutain and force staff hooks! yey! :p)**
  + Control groups are now saved to the cloud, per hero, and will persist across games and disconnects. They are saved per hero.**
  + Alt-left clicking on an enemy icon in the top bar will send a chat message that the hero is missing**
  + Beginning soon, users will be suspended from Dota 2 for 30 days when external tools attached to Dota 2 are detected by the Valve Anti-Cheat system.**
  + The quality of the item drops you are eligible for is now tied to your Dota profile level. You can see your current drop level in your profile page.**

Now the only thing missing is Phoenix, my favourite hero.
