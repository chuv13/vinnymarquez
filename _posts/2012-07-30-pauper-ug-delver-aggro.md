<span class="dropcap1">H</span>appy monday! I haven&#8217;t been able to blog lately because the past week was really hectic plus I recently upgraded my MBP to <a title="Mountain Lion" href="http://www.apple.com/osx/" target="_blank">Mountain Lion</a>. Sigh. Its cool and all but it broke my <a title="Reaper" href="http://www.reaper.fm/" target="_blank">Reaper</a>! Anyways, thats for another blog post. For now I&#8217;ll talk about <a title="Magic: the Gathering" href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/" target="_blank">Magic: the Gathering</a> again.

We&#8217;re going to have a Pauper tournament here in the office (un-sanctioned because we don&#8217;t know any TOs) so I tried my hands on Magic the Gathering deck building. I&#8217;m a big fan of weenies and aggro decks so I decided to build a deck around the latest broken card to come of MtG: <a href="http://magiccards.info/isd/en/51a.html" target="_blank">Delver of Secrets</a>. I decided to use green for <a href="http://magiccards.info/m11/en/178.html" target="_blank">Giant Growth</a>-like abilities to splash for blue&#8217;s drawing power.� I&#8217;m not good with building decks yet and this is arguably the first deck I built from scratch so any (constructive )suggestions will be welcomed with a smile.� Here is the deck list:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="UG Delver" alt="UG Delver" src="http://i1169.photobucket.com/albums/r511/johnvinnymarquez/ugdelverlist.jpg" width="600" height="383" />

Aside from Delver I run <a title="Silhana Ledgewalker" href="http://magiccards.info/pc2/en/77.html" target="_blank">Silhana Ledgewalkers</a> which don&#8217;t have as much power but has hex-proof. For pumps I got the ever so wonderful <a title="Rancor" href="http://magiccards.info/m13/en/185.html" target="_blank">Rancor</a>, the ninja move-like <a title="Vines of Vastwood" href="http://magiccards.info/zen/en/193.html" target="_blank">Vines of Vastwood</a>, <a title="Groundswell" href="http://magiccards.info/wwk/en/104.html" target="_blank">Groundswell</a> and <a title="Mutagenic Growth" href="http://magiccards.info/nph/en/116.html" target="_blank">Mutagenic Growth</a>. For drawing power and fixing the top cards (for an almost perma <a title="Insectile Aberration" href="http://magiccards.info/isd/en/51b.html" target="_blank">Insectile Aberration</a>) <a title="Brainstorm" href="http://magiccards.info/cmd/en/40.html" target="_blank">Brainstorm</a>, <a title="Gitaxian Probe" href="http://magiccards.info/nph/en/35.html" target="_blank">Gitaxian Probe</a> and <a title="Ponder" href="http://magiccards.info/m12/en/73.html" target="_blank">Ponder</a>. For utility I included <a title="Vapor Snag" href="http://magiccards.info/ddh/en/58.html" target="_blank">Vapor Snag</a> for removal and <a title="Apostle's Blessing" href="http://magiccards.info/nph/en/2.html" target="_blank">Apostle&#8217;s Blessing</a> for additional protection.

I haven&#8217;t tested this realtime (I just use [mtgdeckbuilder.net][1]) so I do hope this works though <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

EDIT: Anyone who knows any free widgets you can use to display decks? I wouldn&#8217;t want to build one from scatch or always post pics of deck lists. Lol
