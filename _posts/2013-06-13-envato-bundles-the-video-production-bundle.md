I am a fan of Envato and I&#8217;ve purchased a few of their bundles already. I would purchase this if I knew how (or plan) to make videos. Here&#8217;s info from the site itself:

> Create your next (or first) video with any of these video and audio files. We&#8217;ve found 20+ video and audio files, from cutting edge openers, intros, After Effects templates, to instrumental tracks, opening music plus more.
> 
> This bundle, which is **worth more than $500**, is **now just $29** for 14 days only.
> 
> The bundle runs until noon on the **26th of June <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Video+Production+Bundle+ends&iso=20130626T12&p1=152" target="_blank">AEST</a>**, so [act fast!][1]

If you are interested, the said item is available for purchase <a href="http://videohive.net/bundles/videoproduction?wt.mc_id=bundles_microsite" target="_blank">here</a>.
