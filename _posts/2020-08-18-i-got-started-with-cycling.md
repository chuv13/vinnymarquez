I recently accepted a job located in Manila. We had to relocate to Sampaloc. Whenever I need to go to the office, I ride the bike to work.

My father in law gave me an old hybrid roadbike built with an MTB frame.

Planning Step
--------------------------

The plan is to restore this with the following parts:

GT Hybrid:
- Alloy Drop Bar (https://s.lazada.com.ph/s.bEjsO)
- Stem (https://s.lazada.com.ph/s.bESmL)
- Claris Group set (https://www.facebook.com/193987731355813/posts/746854329402481/, https://www.facebook.com/406968416377811/posts/841375892937059/)
- Front/Rear Disk break adapter (https://shopee.ph/product/83584840/1569468158?smtt=0.0.9)
- Wheelset (Rim/spokes/hub/tires) 
- Mechanical/Hydro disc break caliper (https://s.lazada.com.ph/s.bEMwt)

Paint
--------------------------

I found this paint shop [West Custom Shop](https://www.facebook.com/westcustomshop/). I was quoted 1,600PHP for pearl white with a black GT logo what would take anywhere between 2-3 days.
