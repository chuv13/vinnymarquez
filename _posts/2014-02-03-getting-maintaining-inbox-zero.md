One of the main activities that I am very fond of these days is design. Especially designing and optimizing my activities. I’m tackling the small issues first to get the hang of fixing things. One of these so-called activities is &#8216;dealing with my email&#8217;.

Some people believe that email is broken. Well, I am now convinced that we’re the ones that are broken (or at least I&#8217;m the one that is broken). I’ve relied too much on tools, but in reality it was my habits concerning emails that were broken. I signed up for every service, magazine, blog, publication that piqued my interest. I had to digest so much to digest in so little time in the most unorganized manner.

I decided that I&#8217;ve had enough (ok, [Franchere][1] has been trying to help me understand this for years now) decided that I had to make email work for me again. I figured that the first step is too reach “Inbox Zero”. What is Inbox Zero? It’s a state that there are no more emails in your inbox. Why? The inbox is supposed to be a place for important emails, not a place to store ALL your emails.

Here are the activities I went through:

Reaching Inbox Zero:

*   Unsubscribe to mailing lists that you do not need
*   Manage your emails manually. Google’s filters (yahoo’s don’t work) are good for cleaning up emails, but not a good idea to auto-move emails when they arrive.


Maintaining Inbox Zero:

*   Consume what you can. Maintain ONLY the subscriptions you need.
*   Primary email, with backup. It’s hard enough to maintain one.
*   When you receive an email, read it then decide what to do with it ASAP. (Archive, Delete, Forward, Reply or whatever)
*   Use awesome email clients (that will fit your needs) 
    *   OSX: I don&#8217;t like Apple’s default Mail app. I use Sparrow or Mail Pilot instead.
    *   Windows: Outlook. Thunderbird. For work I use Outlook, MailBird for personal use.
    *   Web: Google is better than Yahoo.

It took me a more than half a day to clean my inbox and I&#8217;m now enjoying it! Well, my personal emails are done. Moving on to work email. Zzz.

How about you? Have you reached the &#8216;Inbox Zero&#8217; state? Any tips? Comments and suggestions are welcome.
