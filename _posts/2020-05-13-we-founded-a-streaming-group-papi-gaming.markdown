We were saddened with the demise of [Henlo, Chimkin](https://www.facebook.com/titoscience/), my previous streaming group. My wife and I have been planning to resurrect and transform it to a console game stream but we still haven't figured out how to get the Animal Crossing Limited Edition switch... no go.

So about a month ago, I was invited by Ron (of 'The Wardens PH' fame) to help setup the tech for the streaming group. After a discussion, I was finally added to the roster. Papi Gaming is composed of 5 guys: Me, Ron, Rej, Ken, and KM.

## WHAT GAMES DO WE STREAM?
{% include image_full.html imageurl="/assets/blog/posts/papi-gaming/new-world.jpg" title="New World" caption="" %}
We originally planned on streaming Amazon's new and upcoming MMORPG, [New World](https://www.newworld.com/en-us). However, due to the delays introduced by human malware, the beta phase keeps getting pushed back. So we decided to play Call of Duty: Warzone, Dead by day light, and other games while waiting for our beta access.

## ROLES
Currently, we have 2 active streamers: Ken & Rej. Ken streams 7pm-10pm weekdays, while Rej starts at 11pm and ends at 1am the next day. The rest take care of the content, regular posting, multimedia editing, and growing the channel's follower base; basically anything we can find that's helpful to the group.

Here's a sample of one of our streams.


## THE FUTURE
We've been aiming to steadily increase our viewership, while dealing with technical issues like a couple members (including me) having slow internet. Getting the team used to the intricacies of streaming, navigating our way with our new found vocation.

We know It's a lot of work, and we need to be consistent and always be improving.
