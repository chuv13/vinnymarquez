We had our 3rd Lesson with <a href="http://www.sirnicolay.com" target="_blank">SirNicolay</a> yesterday (May 5, 2013) which was about still life and landscape. As usual we were prepped up with the basic techniques needed with this kind of photography and after that he sent us off to take pics.

My brother and I were both struggling with landscape. Its just isn&#8217;t our thing (maybe for now) but still, I do feel the need to learn techniques here for street photography. My macro photos faired better than my landscape ones (if they can ever be called that). I think I also faired better with cityscapes/architectural shots.

After shooting SirNicolay reviewed our pics and provided insight (and sometimes praise) on the way we take (imagine, compose, shoot) our shots. I felt this session was the most unproductive for me because of my lack of &#8216;vision&#8217; for this kind of photography. I was surprised though with the macro flower photos I took were more popular (can still be counted with my fingers, lol) than all of my other photos.

Anyway, I took 262 pics and only around 6 of them were appealing to me. Here are my shots:

You can view more of my pics on my <a href="http://500px.com/JohnVinnyMarquez" target="_blank">500px acount</a>. I would appreciate it if you&#8217;ll vote and/or favorite any of my work that you will find interesting.

Hmmm&#8230; I just realized I like &#8217;tilting&#8217; on most of my pics (especially those related with architecture). What do you think? Any comments? I would love to hear from you. Hit up the comments section below.
