I&#8217;ve been very busy for the past few weeks. I&#8217;m currently developing <a href="http://francherechan.com/" target="_blank">my GF&#8217;s Food and travel blog</a>, <a href="http://ftlwerkz.com/" target="_blank">FTLWerkz&#8217;s site</a> and now my <a href="http://rayvincentmarquez.com/" target="_blank">brother&#8217;s site</a> too. So I just switched from Orchard CMS to WordPress again for ease of use. I will resume studying and exploring Orchard when I fin the time. For now I will focus on getting things up and running and proper content.
