<span class="dropcap1">I</span>&#8216;ve been busy last week with my valentines day surprise for Mawie that I haven&#8217;t been able to blog for the past few days. That&#8217;s because besides from going out with her, I secretly recorded vocal tracks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnTE_jn5q2M&context=C349c630ADOEgsToPDskIs3ol_hKkF7v5oRPKjCnox" target="_blank">for a valentines day surpise</a> by me and my friends (Elmar, Alvin and Jovy). It found it really really hard to balance my time! Not to mention how tough it was to keep it as a secret (although I can only keep that way because I kept telling her that its a surprise and she should&#8217;nt ). But it was worth all the trouble because it was a gift for our girlfriends. I&#8217;m really glad Mawie loved it! As a side note, the activity also provided us with male bonding time albeit digitally and that is always a good thing considering how disconnected people are these days. I really enjoyed my first home recording session and if any of my readers (if there are any) opt to request a song, [just message me][1], *maybe* we can add your song to our list.

For our monthsary / valentines day date, we had dinner at <a href="http://hotelceleste.ph" target="_blank">Celi&#8217;s Restaurant at Hotel Celeste</a>. The food was good but the ambiance was better (european setting). We had a 3 course meal (c/o a voucher I bought from <a href="http://www.cashcashpinoy.com/" target="_blank">CashCashPinoy</a>) while a being serenaded by a guy with a guitar playing love songs. At first I really did&#8217;nt like the songs he sang, did&#8217;nt know why, but then I requested &#8220;Englishman in New York&#8221; just for kicks&#8230; to my surprise he actually did a good job on that song. Lol. talk about turning the tables. We had so much fun eating, relaxing and eating there with my requested song for closing time. <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Pics will be posted when I get them from Mawie.

I recently bought a <a href="http://www.levysleathers.com/browse;cat,868;Straps" target="_blank">Levi&#8217;s Leathers Guitar Strap</a> for Caleb (my white electric guitar) with the text &#8220;Giggin&#8217; for God&#8221; as decoration. Mawie&#8217;s guitar Cerise (which I also happen to have in my possession) also has a Levi&#8217;s strap, her strap says &#8220;Blessed&#8221; in the same location as mine. I love the feel of these straps, they&#8217;re very simple but construction seems to be durable and these design are basically what we&#8217;ve been looking for: sort of like the messages from the Christian t-shirt brand Fig Tree. We bought the said straps from <a href="http://www.sound-essentials.com/" target="_blank">Sound Essentials</a> (MOA/SM North), they have really nice, friendly attendants unlike in other stores (I am not an endorser, I&#8217;m just fond of their products and services).

On the fashion side of my world. Lol. I recently acquired a pair of <a href="http://www.toms.com/mens/cordones/ash-waxed-twill-men-s-cordones" target="_blank">Tom&#8217;s Ash Waxed Twill Men&#8217;s Cordones</a> (with a slight prodding from Mawie, I gave in!). Well, they&#8217;re much more comfortable that Sanuks and a little more pricier, but considering the fact that <a href="http://www.toms.com" target="_blank">they give a pair to a child in need for every purchase</a>, for me thats a bargain.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="" src="http://images.toms.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/side/900x640/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/-/m-ash-waxed-twill-cordones-s-f10_1.jpg" width="450" height="320" />

Anyway, next in my plate is another cover video, a super secret album, a DIY project for my guitars a few upgrades to this site and maybe I get to start on brainstorming for an application that mawie and I want to create. So much to do! Lolz.

In closing, I&#8217;d like to share a verse that has helped me go through a lot in my life. It is a very awesome reminder of how GREAT GOD is!

> #### Do Not Worry
> 
> <span>    </span><sup>25</sup> “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? <sup>26</sup> Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? <sup>27</sup>Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?
> 
> <span>    </span><sup>28</sup> “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. <sup>29</sup> Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. <sup>30</sup> If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? <sup>31</sup> So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. <sup>33</sup> But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. <sup>34</sup> Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
> 
> #### Matthew 6:25-34
> 
> New International Version (NIV)

Thank You Lord! All Honor, Glory and Praise to Your Name!
