<span class="dropcap1">A</span>h, after a long while I finally get to write another post. And this time I&#8217;ll tackle a subject that I am recently very fond of: Fitness.

Tech people are usually committed, driven and competitive individuals. We love challenges and solving problems but most of the time, our jobs become counter productive to our wellness: extended hours, irregular shifts, stressful environments, bad eating habits, lack of excercise and lack of work-life balance. A alot of our bretheren succumb to the effects meetings and deadlines but there are a good number of people who take the time to try to defeat the signs of aging. Lols.

**Enough with the stereotypes**

I am a geek, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that I am a pushover too. For around 2 years now, I have decided to compete with myself. I push myself to train so that I can muster the strength I need when the situation calls for it. After all, I believe that God created us as warriors and keepers of peace. How can I do my duty if I am not ready?

Another reason I have for doing sports is because of the fellowship that comes along with these activities. The friendship and camaraderie that we develop while trying to be stronger together. It might sound cheesy but yeah, thats how it works. I have been blessed with a girlfriend who loves to do sporty stuff with me and good office friends (who each have their own activities) on top of the great environment we have in Magenic Manila (Rivereo Inc.). I have an officemate who used to run marathons competetively up to a point that he had a career ending injury. Another officemate used to be a college varsity basketball player. Another one regulary goes trekking/climbing/biking and another one does BJJ/MMA. These people work in the Tech industry. These are the very same people who live and breathe software development and share some of my hobbies like Magic: the Gathering and DoTA. In an article I read recently regarding the <a title="35 fittest people in tech" href="http://mashable.com/2012/08/19/the-35-fittest-people-in-tech/#view_as_one_page-gallery_box7029" target="_blank">35 fittest people in tech</a>, we can see that even high profile people like Sergey Brin, Tim Cook and ofcourse the Winklevoss twins are into sports. I am loving the fact the a lot more people are pushing to be [Renaissance men (Polymath)][1] and break through the stereotypical image of a Tech worker.

**Its never too late to start**

I used to drink and smoke a lot (thanks to God I was able to conquer my vices); I do not know how much damage I acquired in those 12 years of self inflicted abuse. It been almost 3 years since I stopped, but I can say that I was significantly weakened: my movements aren&#8217;t as quick as before, my stamina is at an all time low and I think I have a few injuries that make it difficult for me to train. But all of these things plus the fact that I have around 4 years until I reach my prime won&#8217;t stop me from my personal fitness goals. My personal routine maybe light compared to others but it works for me. I lift weights at home every T-TH (whenever I can I do extra training on Saturdays), every M-W I do some MMA excercises/routines with officemates and on fridays I play basketball with them. Because of the time constraint, I work out at home for about 45 mins and my routine looks like this:

Tue: Arnold Press, Barbell Military Raise, Dumbell Shrugs, (Abs)

Thu: Dumbell Bench Press (+ incline and decline), Hammer Curls, (Abs)

Sat: Tabata Sledgehammer, Dumbell Catch, Weighted Squats, (Abs)

I do this at home using adjustable dumbells and barbells which cost me around Php12K for everything including the mat and the adjustable bench rated for 200lbs (bought from <a href="http://ensayofitness.com" target="_blank">Ensayo Fitness</a>).

**Recommended Activities**

So you finally want to start working out those unused muscles huh? Here are some activities available (this is in no way a complete list, just some of the activies that I know of) in the Philippines you can look at:

*   ***Go to the gym** *- This is the first thing that come into mind regarding fitness. Fitness First, Gold&#8217;s Gym and Slimmers World are the leading facilities in the metro. I used to go to Gold&#8217;s but then decided to get my own equipment.
*   ***Running* **- This is as popular as going to the gym here in the Philippines. Remember to learn proper form before getting serious or you will be seriously injured.
*   ***Biking*** &#8211; This is really fun. For as long as I remember I love bikes and motorcycles. The problem is we don&#8217;t have bicycle lanes (except in Marikina).
*   ***Hiking/Climbing*** &#8211; If you are the outdoors type this is perfect for you. Try <a href="http://greatadventurepilipinas.com/" target="_blank">Great Adventure Pilipinas</a>.
*   ***Team Sports*** 
    *   ***Basketball*** &#8211; Basketball is officially the nation&#8217;s sport (though I think boxing is a good runner up due to tito Manny. lols).
    *   ***Badminton*** &#8211; A lot of people are getting into badminton these days because of the good workout and accessibility of facilities (I used to be a tennis player so this is a taboo for me).
*   ***Water Sports*** 
    *   ***Rowing*** &#8211; I think there&#8217;s a dragon boat team in CCP. Just look around the interwebs for this.
*   ***Extreme Sports*** 
    *   ***Board sports** *- Skate, surf, skim&#8230; anything with a board!
    *   ***Moto-X*** &#8211; In cavite there&#8217;s a moto-x course near Super 8 in Molino Boulevard. I don&#8217;t know any in the metro though.
*   ***Martial Arts** *- Is everywhere! Just search for arts in google or go to <a href="http://www.fmaforum.org/" target="_parent">FMA Forum</a> and search for gyms there. Try my personal favorite: <a href="http://sayawngkamatayan.com/" target="_blank">Fervillion Yaw-Yan</a>.
*   ***Get a standing desk*** &#8211; This I&#8217;d like to try, but I&#8217;m scared of getting varicose veins. Lols.

There you have it, I hope this article inspires you to be fit as much as you want your code to be elegant. Any suggestions and comments you can place on the comments section. Looking forward to hearing from you! <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
