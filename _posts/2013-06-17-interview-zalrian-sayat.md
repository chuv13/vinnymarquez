Finally! An interview NOT for the MUSIC section! This is my first photographer interview. My subject for today is one of my influences and close family friend [Zalrian Sayat][1]. He has been one of the people I look up to when it comes to professional photography. He&#8217;s based in Legazpi and does photography for a living. I wanted to know his thoughts about his chosen craft so, here we go!

**Me:** Hi kuya, can you please introduce yourself?

**Ryan:** I am Zalrian S. Sayat. My name came from the combined names of my two grandfathers jose protacio riZAL zuniga and maRIANo sayat. But most of the people call me Ryan or Rye.

**Me:** How did you get into photography?

**Ryan:� **I got into visual arts at first during my elementary years which I got national awards. Then that was also the time where I was able to hold my father’s Film Camera (Canon AE-1 Program) which I usually brought every time I went to different places for my poster making contests for me to have my own photo souvenirs.

**Me:** Heroes/Influences?

**Ryan:� **At a very young age, my father and my hero (BAYANI SAYAT) influenced me a lot because he was not just an enthusiast but a photography addict which ironically was not his profession because he was working as a Budget Officer in our Municipality. Photography was just his sideline job over the weekends for weddings and event assignments. I was always there to assist him.

**Me:** Whats the first camera that you ever used?

**Ryan:� **As mentioned earlier, the first camera I ever used was my father’s SLR’s and over the years, he entrusted his treasured camera to me: a NIKON F3 High Point which he had dreamed about for years.

**Me:** Best camera you&#8217;ve got to use so far?

**Ryan:� **I can’t remember it anymore sa sobrang dami ko ng nahawakang cameras.:) (*tn: I can&#8217;t remember anymore because of the many cameras I&#8217;ve already handled) � *but the best I got so far at this moment are my own DSLR’s (Canon EOS 6D and Canon EOS 60D), but good cameras won&#8217;t do the job on its own since you also need a good choice of lenses. I am using Canon EF 24-70mm f2.8 USM, Canon EF 70-200mm f2.8 USM, Canon EF 85mm f1.8 USM, and Canon EFS 10-22mm f3.5-4.5 USM. Samyang 8mm fish eye f3.5.

**Me:** How can you describe your style of photography?

**Ryan:� **Maybe I can describe it as a projection of my personality. My style is the extension of my perceptions, emotions and point of views. I always have this saying that, “I just don&#8217;t take pictures; I create them as people feel them and as I imagine them to be.”

**Me:** Lets talk about gear, most specifically what you bring&#8230;

&#8230;On assignment?

**Ryan:� **On assignments like weddings or events coverage, I bring all my gears as much as I can. Always be a boy scout.

**Me:** On a photo walk, vacation or casual shoot?

**Ryan:� **For this, I usually bring two camera bodies and two lenses. I use the Canon EF 24-70mm f2.8 USM for general shots� and the Canon EFS 10-22mm f3.5- 4.5 USM for landscapes and sceneries.

**Me:** Your studio setup?

**Ryan:� **I am not a studio-type photographer for the reason that I’m not a fan of studio/artificial lights. Most of my photo shoots were done outdoors with ambient lighting. Natural lighting is still the finest source of light.

**Me:** When did you start to realize that you can turn PRO?

**Ryan:� **When I realized that I already had enough foundation, knowledge and experience in my field. But in my own perception, being a **PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER** is not just being professional in your photography but also be a professional in other aspects, most especially with your� **ETHICS**.

**Me:** I know for a fact that you started with film cameras. Do you still use film from time to time?

**Ryan:� **Yup, I still do use SLR’s. I have my Nikon F3 hp and a Nikkor 50mm f1.4. I often use it with black & white KODAK iso400 films and other expired films. Basically, when you start your photography with film, you will never forget how to shoot with it. That feeling of thrill and excitement is what drives your passion; you can find that in shooting film. There are also some qualities that you can only get from films specifically, analog film noise or grains.

**Me:** How did technology affect the art of photography? Moreover, how did it affect you?

**Ryan:� **The evolution from analog to digital has affected the world of photography. I prefer to call it the CLIMATE CHANGE in Photography. This evolution is just a part of it, since the foundations of photography doesn’t change at all. If you can learn how to adapt to these changes, you will learn to survive. On my part, I was lucky enough to adapt these developments in perfect timing since it started between my education on film and computer technology. At first it’s sort of confusing, convincing yourself which one fits you and your comfort zone. Because of my foundation in basic photography, I am equipped with the guidelines to embrace these changes.

**Me:** How do you take advantage of social networks?

**Ryan:� **It’s a big leap for me when I started using social networking for my marketing strategy. The existence of social networking provides the fastest and most reliable connection to our market. For now, I’m using Facebook as my main marketing tool as I see the advantage of using it since the said service allows the subscribers to see content in a feed containing your work/photos. Comments in these works may also act as testimonies to possible clients.

**Me:** Thoughts on the local photography scene?

**Ryan:� **There is misconception with the separation of professionals and amateurs since more and more people are being able to afford DSLRs. People are also getting involved in the photography industry very prematurely and this leads to misunderstanding what the industry is all about. Newbies already cater clients without the proper experience and foundation. Because of them being so passionate, they think that they are prepared enough to tackle the industry. Some also think they have to have the best gear to symbolize their professionalism. I quote, “The photography industry is not just about photography…It’s about the whole package.”

**Me:** I notice a lot of people who can afford DSLRs now. In your opinion, how can a person like me (a noob) become better at taking pictures?

**Ryan:� **Photography for me is about self-expression. So, start by knowing yourself. It is your thoughts that fuels your interest on the things that you want. And that interest drives your passion, and that passion leads to expression. That expression is a mirror of you and your photography will speak of your personality.

**Me:** I also noticed that a lot of people (at least in my clique) are interested to do Wedding Photography. What does it really take to be one?

**Ryan:� **Wedding Photography industry is the hardest field I have handled so far. Wedding is a very broad field of photography, starting from taking pictures of the bride’s accessories (product photography), portraits of the bride/groom/couple (portrait/fashion photography), wedding ceremony (photojournalism), reception (landscape/architectural photography), foods and beverages (food photography). So, if you are planning to be a wedding photographer, you have to learn first what weddings are all about.

**Me:** If you were a flower, what would you be and why?

**Ryan: **A**� **Sunflower. Because its behaviour teaches us to constantly look on the brighter side of life.

**Ryan:� **I&#8217;ve always dreamt of helping other people� through my God-given talent, � especially with my knowledge in photography. Photography is a powerful medium that could change the world. I quote again, “Photography is not about showing, it about sharing.”

**Me:** That concludes our interview.� Thank you for giving me an opportunity to feature you in my blog! <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
