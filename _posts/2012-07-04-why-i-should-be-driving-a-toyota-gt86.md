  <span>I would love to have the new Toyota GT86/Scion FR-S/Subaru BRZ! Why? Because I remember driving a go cart back in my college days. It was the most magical driving experience I&#8217;ve ever had (to date) and it was the time when me and Mawie first met. Yikeee! It was because the cart I had that day had tires with not so optimal grip and I experienced magical go-cart handling with real wheel drive. Man did I push that little engine as hard as I can. I finally understood the fundamental differences between an FF and a FR car. I got hooked. I wanted a full size FR car with go-kart like handling and start to learn real driving (Lol. A lot of people say that you don&#8217;t know how to drive unless you know how to drive an 86). I wanted a car that I can learn car maintenance, customization and other related skills like welding, painting and fabrication. For years I&#8217;ve been dreaming of having my own AE86&#8230; While drooling over enthusiast builds with all sorts of engine swaps and configurations (and watching all those Dori-kin vids) Toyota suddenly the announcement came: a new effort to revive their sports car lineup. I was called the FT86 (forumers also called it the Toyobaru). For more than a year I&#8217;ve been watching the forums churn out info on the then prototype, from paparazzi pics and videos of testing in Nur to fan speculation. Fast forward to 2012 they finally released the Toyota GT86 here in the Philippines. Yey! Im so happy! Except for the fact that I don&#8217;t have any money for it yet (Php 1.5M for the basic manual model) and only 40 are going to be released per year. Sigh.</span>

    <span>So I&#8217;m back to the drawing board still aching to have a taste of this incredible machine. Until I have money to fork out for the new machine, I figured I&#8217;d settle for some old school action. It will be more practical to learn the ropes with an old car rather than with a new one. Why wait for a new car before learning stuff? I figured I&#8217;d start now. So the next problem is, due to the popularity of Initial D and everyone else knowing about the existence of drifting, touge and Dori-kin, the price of an AE86 boosted higher than it should be. I&#8217;m not saying that its not worth it (its a 20+ year old car), all I&#8217;m saying is I&#8217;ve got other priorities and I can&#8217;t shell out that much for a project car. So I decided to go and get myself a Starlet (and this by no means my friends is a consolation, I am merely lowering my spending bracket :p). Same FR layout, shorter wheelbase, same old school tech (can easily drop a 4AGE 20V blacktop on it and I&#8217;d be giggling like a school girl while driving). I would also like to teach Mawie how to drive the stick so with a car like this I wouldn&#8217;t be worrying much about expensive repairs. Yeah, I got her approval too! So now I&#8217;m reading up, saving up and planning how and when to buy what and what courses to take.</span>

      <span>Any schools/short courses you can recommend? Tried searching the TESDA website, Don Bosco and MFI sites. I found MFI schedules to be much more flexible. What do you guys think? Anyone who owns/owned any of the 3 cars mentioned? Looking forward to hearing from you!</span>
