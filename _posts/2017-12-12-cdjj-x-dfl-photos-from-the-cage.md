It’s been a while since I’ve been behind the lens. My OM-D M5 drowned, my 550D pukes out SD cards, and the last time I practiced shooting people was over a year ago (haha, get it? shoot people? haha tito joke).

Thankfully, last weekend (Dec 10, 2017), 2 of our team mates from Academia John Baylon — Clube de Jiujitsu Filipinas went to fight in the Domination Fight League by CYAN Promotions. I had the opportunity to cover their progress throughout the night, albeit somewhat awkwardly.

Pre-fight meditation… or thinking about the post fight crispy pata and beer.

Caption this for me please?

Pre-fight jitters? Or looking forward to nachos later?

Here. We. Go.

I guess coach John is cracking Wallen up with his tito jokes.

Oh hey! Is that a Titojutsu E.S.R.S. shirt you’re wearing Wallen?

Godwin: “Don’t look brah. Too violent!”

“Listen here. Footlocks are not allowed. Ktnxbye.” Lol.

Ref: “You ok?” Wallen: “Just chillin’”

Them titos sipping beer and disappointed with the “Straight Footlock Fiasco”. (Jett, Dave, Paolo, Jonas, Robert, Sev)

Tito Dave. Fanboying. Denice Zamboanga.

Shoutouts
Shots from a borrowed Nikon from Llordgodwin. Mad props to the event ticket for softening the flash. Lol, I tried.
Mara for taking videos of the fights so that I could shoot ’til I drop.
Beer. Beer is ❤.
