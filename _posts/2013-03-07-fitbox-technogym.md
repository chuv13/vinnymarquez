Up until last month I&#8217;ve been experience stress related symptoms (yet again) and I&#8217;m going through restructuring my life. I&#8217;ve been doing so much in so little time that I forgot to set aside time for alone time, eat right, sleep right and exercise. Enough is enough.

Last week me and my officemates found this gym called FITBOX Technogym near our office, located at: 2nd Floor, PLaza 100 Building, corner of Rufino and De la Rosa, Makati.

  Its a bit pricey (there are discounts for the first 100 early birds) but thats because of the premium and new equipment, adequate instructors for Boxing, Muay Thai and MMA (one of the owners said that he found a way for the instructors available everyday for every kind of discipline). Instructors teach 1 on 1 for now.

  Workout area, treadmills, step machine, sandbags, speed balls etc. I didn&#8217;t want to stand up and get a new angle because I was too tired to do so.

  <h4>
    TRX

  <p>
    I always wanted to own one (or atleast try one) and now I can use it whenever I&#8217;m at the gym with no additional charge. Yeah!

    I saw this excercise being demoed by Brandon Vera, so I gave it a try. The instructor who was taking this photo sure took his time: I did around 20-30 of these before collapsing to the ground.

  <h4>
    Trainors
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    I ï¿½ am very happy with the way the instructors treat their students. They joke around, push you hard till you drop and you&#8217;ll enjoy it. You don&#8217;t have to do anything (i.e. wave money around) for you to be trained properly.

    Weights
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    They have dumbells, kettelbells, benches and a multi-machine. Sorry, I forgot to take pictures of them and you&#8217;ll just have to take my word for it.
  </p>
  
  <h4 style="text-align: left;">
    Shower Rooms
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Shower rooms are non-communal, so you get your own bowl, mirror, hot water equipped shower with multiple nozzles and your own phone (intercom, for emergencies I pressume). They have a total of 4 rooms so there may be a time tha you&#8217;ll have to get it line. Not a deal breaker though, its fine with me, in fact I like this better than all the gyms I&#8217;ve been to.

    Special Guest: Isaiah Ordiz
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    We got lucky today, we got to train alongside Isaiah Ordiz who is I think the face of Fitbox (I see him in the main poster, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong). He&#8217;s really nice and polite.
