<span class="dropcap1">H</span>appy new year! What an awesome year! I feel so much happened that it felt like 5 years has gone by!

Today Mom and Bro arrived from Palawan. Mawie and I picked them up from the airport and went to Cavite. We ate and hanged out for a while, assembled Marvin and Irene&#8217;s gift (a paper world famous architechture set) then I drove Mawie home.

I finally finished Facebook integration with my site! Well, it&#8217;s still crude but I&#8217;m getting there. The site is live, but I haven&#8217;t told anyone yet except for Mawie.

Whew. I have officially lost focus! Haha! I need sleep.

Looking forward to 2012! I leave you guys with one of my favorite verses:

### For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.

- Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)
