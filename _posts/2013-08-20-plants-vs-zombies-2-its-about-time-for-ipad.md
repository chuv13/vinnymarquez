I downloaded this yesterday and had chance to play with it today. This is not a full-fledged review. Just my impressions after less than a day&#8217;s worth of gaming. I MAY do a full review someday or maybe a guide in the future.

### Raves

`Better Graphics` - I played the original version in a pre-retina device so it looks so good on my iPad (3).

`New Plants` - Cool new plants, like the <a title="Bonk Choy" href="http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/Bonk_Choy" target="_blank">&#8220;Bonk Choy&#8221;</a> who punches two cells front and back at a very fast pace (punches a cell around it as a special skill) and the 0 sun cost <a href="http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/Iceberg_Lettuce" target="_blank">Iceberg Lettuce</a> that freezes one cell and is triggered like the <a href="http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/Potato_Mine" target="_blank">Potato Mine</a> (freezes all visible zombies on screen as a special skill).

`New zombies` - There&#8217;s a this new zombie that steals sunlight using his staff and a group of zombies hiding behind egyptian panels to name a few. The most annoying one so far is the one that carries a torch in his hand because he can easily set fire to plants (but can be easily countered by using the <a href="http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/Iceberg_Lettuce" target="_blank">Iceberg Lettuce</a>).

<p>
 New Mechanics &#8211; I like the new mechanics like <a href="http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/Plant_Food" target="_blank">&#8220;Plant Food&#8221;</a>, it brings out the special abilities of plants when you feed it to them. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/Power_Ups" target="_blank">Dave&#8217;s powers</a> and some mini games (as usual).

### Rant

<p>
  `Premium content` - I feel like the game took the direction that I don&#8217;t like. If I like a game, I purchase the game but I don&#8217;t like the idea that I have to purchase items that make direct changes to the gameplay. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, its not that I don&#8217;t like paying for my games (or in-app purchases). I buy stuff on Steam, I play DoTA2 and purchase items from the store but these have nothing to do with the game play: I can enjoy the game with or without these purchases. Going back to PVZ2, why do I have to pay $3.99 for the Snow Pea that I loved to use in the 1st version? Yeah, I know there are new plants, mechanics and stuff but I would rather pay for the whole game and have in-app purchases that do not affect the gameplay directly (like say, purchasing of gold coins?). Take a look at the screenshots below:

### Conclusion

<p>
  Other than my only rant I believe that PopCap has done a good job with this one. The feel and gaming experience is solid, offering new stuff while not deviating from the award winning formula of the original. I highly recommend this game to anyone! Even if its freemium, its still free! If you don&#8217;t want to pay for in-game purchases then finish the game without them, maybe that more hardcore. Lol.

<p>
  I will leave you with another game from the franchise that I&#8217;m also looking forward to: <a href="http://www.popcap.com/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare" target="_blank">Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare</a>!
