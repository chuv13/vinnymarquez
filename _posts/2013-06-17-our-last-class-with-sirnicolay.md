[Another later post]

According to the<a href="http://sirnicolay.blogspot.com/p/photography-courses.html" target="_blank"> photography course list in Sir Nicolay&#8217;s website</a>, Outdoor and Street Photography is the last lesson that we should be taking but we accidentally missed our HDR sched so it got bumped up to the back of our itinerary.

Anyway, I&#8217;m not really any good with landscapes but I really had a good time with exploring HDR. Here are some of the pics I took that day.

    &#8220;Where are my unicorns?&#8221; The only HDR worth posting. Meh.

I am thankful to Sir James Nicolay for these courses, which are to me very noob (yes, that&#8217;s me) friendly. The lessons helped consolidate all the scattered knowledge I have read on the internet about the art of photography. I recommend his lessons for those who want to start photography. Take a look at <a href="http://sirnicolay.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">his site here</a>.

Maybe a month or so of experimentation and I&#8217;ll take the next courses that I want to take at PCCI. (My brother already took &#8220;Outdoor Portraiture&#8221; ahread of me. Boo!)
