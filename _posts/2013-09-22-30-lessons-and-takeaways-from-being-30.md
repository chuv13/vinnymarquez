As you know (or may not know), I recently celebrated my 18th birthday. Lol. After some internalization and retrospection I came up with this long list that sums up the most of the important things I&#8217;ve learned.

I&#8217;m sharing it with you guys in the hopes that you may pickup a thing or two. Sharing is caring, right?

So here it goes. Ready? <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

30. **Prioritization is very important**. It&#8217;s ok to have a lot of skills, hobbies and stuff as long as you can focus on the right things at the right time.

29. **Diversity of skills is necessary**. Yes, you want to master something and no one is going to take that away from you, but learning and adapting a few skills here and there won&#8217;t hurt. A diverse skill-set will actually help you stand out from the crowd.

28. **Content is king, but you need marketing too.** A great product will make no sense if nobody knows about it. Now, think of yourself as your main product.

27. **Old habits die hard, but it&#8217;s never too late to change**. That is if you have the humility to accept your shortcomings and the guts to change.

26. **Be wise with spending your money**. You don&#8217;t have to be a miser, you can enjoy the fruits of your labor while saving for the future. Stop being a compulsive buyer. I have 40+ video games I haven&#8217;t played yet; card games I seldom use; and gadgets that have novel value, but have no practical use. These could have been allocated to more important purchases. Gadgets are essential up to a certain point but please maximize your your gear. Buying gadgets just for the sake of updating is a waste of money.

25. **You are the one who drives your career**. It&#8217;s a hard reality that you will have to accept. Not getting the growth that you want at work? Be vocal about it with top management. If it doesn&#8217;t work out, find an organization where you can grow.

24. **The world is not in short supply of Prima Donnas, you don&#8217;t have to be one**. In fact, try your hardest not to be one.

23. **A manager and a leader are two entirely different animals**. Know the difference by heart. I&#8217;d rather be the latter.

22. **Having a lot of &#8220;friends&#8221; is great, but you can only be in contact with around 150 at a time** (148 to be exact, search for Dunbar&#8217;s number). In short, yes, you have 9999999 friends on Facebook, but you can only maintain stable (and meaningful) social relationships with 150 (maximum) at a time (I can only manage much less than that). And…

21. **Be sure to have positive people in your &#8220;Inner Circle&#8221;**. Remember the saying &#8220;Show me who your friends are and I&#8217;ll tell you who you are&#8221;? It&#8217;s cliche I know, but don&#8217;t keep hanging out with Negatrons if you want to be an Optimist Prime! Lol. Like it or not, the environment plays a big role in the shaping your character.

20. **Stand for something, if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll fall for everything**. (yeah, taken from Alexander Hamilton) And remember that…

19. **You cannot change anything besides yourself**. Want corruption to end? Want to change the world? Before going to the streets and protesting (which I think has its purpose and should be done at the right time), take a look at yourself first. If you find something wrong with the way you live, change that first before trying to change the world.

18. **Listening (with understanding) is a very important skill**. Master it. Listen first before you speak out because you have to…

17. **Be careful with words and choose your words wisely**. It&#8217;s easy to be misunderstood. Think about how your words are going to affect the person you are talking to. Words have power. I know it&#8217;s not easy, and it will never be. This is one of those struggles that you will have to fight with all throughout your life.

16. **Unlearning is one of the most difficult activities in this world**. Sooner or later, you will have to deal with it; the sooner, the better.

15. **You are biased**. Period. It will take extra effort to become unbiased; be aware of that fact.

14. **Don&#8217;t work hard, work smart**. Do more with less time; rest and maintain work-life balance.

13. **Don&#8217;t bring personal problems to work and vice-versa**. Yes, you may have friends at work, but you should never blur the lines between work and personal matters.

12. **Travel while you can**. There&#8217;s no sense in saving money for travelling when you&#8217;re at the retirement age. You may not be able to do some things when you are older.

11. **Procrastination kills**. Period.

10. **Don&#8217;t stop learning; don&#8217;t stop reading**. Read books which are out of your comfort zone. Try out things that pique your interest even if you have no prior knowledge about them. � Reading helps ageing brains stay sharp.� Make it a habit.

9. **Eating is an awesome activity, but you really have to watch what you eat**. You can die from a bad diet. Seriously. Which brings me to my next point:

8. **Move, be active, and exercise**. There&#8217;s no running away from it. Pun intended.

7. **What won&#8217;t kill you will make you stronger**. Mistakes make you stronger only if you learn from them. If you do not, you will repeat these mistakes, and they become bad habits that will be difficult to change.

6. **Step out of your comfort zone**. It&#8217;s ok to be afraid; you can&#8217;t be brave if you&#8217;re not scared. It&#8217;s ok to take that first step even if you&#8217;re shaking as long as you take it.

5.** Ageing is mandatory, but growing up is optional**. Being childlike in some areas is cool and applaudable, but being a childish in areas that you are required to be dependable on is a big no-no. Play games, have a happy mindset, and feel young, but don&#8217;t run away from responsibilities; put-off stuff that need to be done, and learn to respect people because&#8230;

4. **Everyone has their own opinion about everything under the sun**. Take it as it is. Learn to respect other people&#8217;s opinions. You don&#8217;t have to agree with them, but you don&#8217;t have to bash their heads for having a completely different way of thinking. You are special no matter what so why argue? And remember that…

3.** You can&#8217;t please everybody so stop trying**. You can chase after success, but it&#8217;s better to chase after excellence. (some Rancho, anyone? :))

2. **You can&#8217;t give something that you don&#8217;t have.**� You can&#8217;t teach something you know nothing about, and you definitely can&#8217;t tell others to go do things you didn&#8217;t do yourself. Take your credibility seriously. Walk the talk.

1. **Live a thankful life. **Always be thankful. Dwell on the things that you are thankful for, and not on the things that you are lacking.

Bonus (This is based on my faith. If this may offend you or you don&#8217;t have any interest in these kinds of things, then simply skip it. Yeah, another idea from John Maxwell :))  
0. **All the these 30 lessons are hinged on this fact: I cannot place my trust in myself**. I have already failed countless times and I will continue on failing. There are things that I cannot change on my own and I have to learn accept that God is the only one who can change them for me. Always try to remember to &#8220;Let go, and Let God&#8221;. Apart from Him, I am nothing (John 15:5).
