<span class="dropcap1">I</span>&#8216;ve decided to start from scratch, scrapping any sort of knowledge I had (if I ever had any) of photography. When I was young My mom taught me how to shoot film but I wasn&#8217;t able to follow through so the meager skills I had then faded into the abyss. Still, the visual side of me kept on wishing I could study photography seriously. Last year I decided to go through with it.

So this here is a noob&#8217;s review of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0074WDDN8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnvinnymarq-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0074WDDN8" target="_blank">Olympus OM-D EM-5</a>, the first of many (hopefully) articles that I am going to write regarding photography. I&#8217;m creating a post category here entitled &#8216;FromZeroToHero&#8217; to mark the documention of my photographic adventures. Some of you may wonder why I chose the EM-5, or even the Micro 4/3 platform? Some of you might wonder why did&#8217;nt I start with a proper DSLR? Or why Olympus? The answer to these questions stem from my love of street photography, the discipline I want to get into. I love the stories from these kinds of photographs and adored these black and white snaps ever since I was young. So I decided I want something light and unobtrusive yet powerful. Why olympus then? Actually I love Canon and Fuji colors and I seriously considered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006UV6YMQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnvinnymarq-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006UV6YMQ" target="_blank">Fuji Xpro1</a> but ended up picking the EM-5 for its features: from the good lens selection (Oly + Pana = win!) to the programmable menus and ergonomics that remind me of the old cameras.

For now, I have the EM-5 body plus the 12-50mm kit lens (24-100mm equivalent in 35mm) and this setup is what I am going to review today. I bought it at <a href="http://www.camerahaus.com" target="_blank">CameraHaus</a> <a href="http://5floormegamall.sulit.com.ph/" target="_blank">MegaMall</a> on promo (47.5K PHP for the package).

### **Size Comparison**

Since I live in the Philippines I used a 5 PHP coin and threw in an SD Card Adapter just to make sure. The camera itself is not much larger than a regular point and shoot: its a little bigger than an LX-5. The kit lens is a bit long for my tastes but atleast its very slim.

### **Handling**

I love the way the camera is constructed. It doesn&#8217;t feel cheap in anyway (well, it really isn&#8217;t&#8230; atleast for me) and the body reminds me of old SLRs like the Canon AE-1 (sorry I never had the chance to hold the old Olympus OM so thats as close as it gets for me). The size and weight is a perfect match for my hand size.

If there&#8217;s one thing that I don&#8217;t like with this camera its the grip, or the absence of one. When I hold the thing singlehandedly I&#8217;m always scared that I&#8217;d drop it (good thing there&#8217;s that thumb grip but it still feels awkward though). Ok, there&#8217;s the battery grip/holder but come on, another 300$ for that? And what about availability in the Phlippines? I haven&#8217;t found any of these babies sold locally so I&#8217;m gonna have to pay premium for one (base cost + shipping fee + customs fee, do the math :p).

### Kit Lens: 14-50mm (28-100mm equivalent)

They say its the shooter not the camera and I believe that is true but in this case I&#8217;m a little confused. Its either the lens is really not that good or I didn&#8217;t learn much within 3 months with shooting with this thing. I achieved good results with using the macro though.

### On the street

I&#8217;m quite happy with this camera and I&#8217;ve been using it every day. Even with the size of the lens it is still unobtrusive. Most of the time people do not notice that I am taking pictures of them. And when they do, I already captured the moment. Its very light and I can whip it out faster than my Mom&#8217;s 550D. I&#8217;m looking forward to having the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055N2L22/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnvinnymarq-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0055N2L22" target="_blank">Panasonic Lumix G Micro 4/3 LEICA DG SUMMILUX 25mm f/1.4 Leica Aspherical Lens</a> for my first prime.

### Conclusion

This camera is not for everyone. Some would opt for a NEX, Xpro1 or the new EOS-M. But if you have the same reasons like mine, I highly recommend this camera. Its small, powerful, noob friendly and fun to shoot with! I bring it wth me every day!
