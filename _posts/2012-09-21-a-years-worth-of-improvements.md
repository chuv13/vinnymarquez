  <span class="dropcap1">W</span>ow, it&#8217;s been a while since I blogged. Not that I have an audience but it&#8217;s really bad to be inconsistent. Anyway, I recently turned 29 (Thank You Lord for another year) and in retrospective (as a scrum guy lol) I asked myself: &#8220;Have you grown this year? If yes, in what areas? Was your growth substantial?&#8221;. After the dialog with myself, I jotted down all I could remember:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  1. <strong>Created my own website/blog from scratch</strong>. This site represents my foray into ASP .net MVC. I created this site from the ground up; one activity I haven&#8217;t been doing in a while since I&#8217;ve been focusing on the presentation layer at work.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  2. <strong>Re-branded myself</strong>. I fixed all of my non-professional references (as recommended by Mawie) from my emails to all the social sites I go to. I now own the first two pages of my name search. I think. Lol.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  3. <strong>Passed the Silverlight 4 certification</strong>. Finally!
</p>

<p class="p1">
  4. <strong>I started teaching</strong>. I got the opportunity to teach for a semester in MINT College PH. Even though I&#8217;m just a temp lecturing about basic programming, I&#8217;m really glad I took the chance and stepped into teaching. I find it very rewarding, teaching younger people and preparing them for the very same industry that I work in. I consider this as the first activity where I really give something back to the community. Plus, I get paid for it!
</p>

<p class="p1">
  5. <strong>Started learning about music production and arranged 2 songs</strong>. Though still very rough and slightly on hold for now, I was able to learn a few things due to my entry for PhilPop. It was nice a experience. Also, my compositions skills are improving. As soon as I free up my schedule, I&#8217;ll be focusing on this again.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  6. <strong>Organized a product dev team outside work</strong>: <a title="http://ftlwerkz.com/" href="http://ftlwerkz.com/" target="_blank">FTLWerkz</a>. The name stands for &#8220;Following The Lion Werkz&#8221; and we are made up of 4 people: 3 debs and 1 pm/sm/ba. Although on hold, we&#8217;re planning a start few projects as soon as we clear our schedules.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  7. <strong>Re-started martial arts training</strong>. Still no official training due to my Mid-shift schedule, but we do MMA circuits and some striking exercises. A colleague of mine teaches us some Jiujitsu techniques as well as core exercises. Its been a while since my body felt this great. I have a lot of catching up to do because of my 12 year body abuse phase. Lol
</p>

<p class="p1">
  8. <strong>Re-structured my wardrobe</strong>. Thanks to Mawie, I actually dress slightly better now. I suddenly remembered my college days. Lol.
</p>

</p>

<p class="p1">
  So with all that, what are my possible targets for this year? From the top of my head I&#8217;d like to:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  1. Do WinRT Development
</p>

<p class="p1">
  2. Do iOS Development
</p>

<p class="p1">
  3. Transition to more UX, learn more about UX
</p>

<p class="p1">
  4. Improve my command of the english language, verbally and written. Someday I want to write my own book.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  5. Get stronger physically, aim for three 5 minute mitts, heavier circuits, improve speed, power, timing and endurance.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  6. Street photography. Oh, and portraits too! I want to do a project next year.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  7. Do a project regarding music production.
</p>

    How about you? Have you looked at your improvements this year?
