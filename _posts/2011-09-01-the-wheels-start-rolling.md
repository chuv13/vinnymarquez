<span class="dropcap1">L</span>ast weekend I started work on my DIY shock mount and pop filter project. Haven&#8217;t been able to acquire materials for the pop filter yet but I&#8217;m done cutting up some pvc pipes, drilling holes and putting hooks on them. Contemplating on getting a larger sized PVC pipe for the outer ring of the shockmount though, there&#8217;s not enough clearance between the inner and outer sections to I&#8217;m affraid of them hitting each other while bearing the load of the mic. Will post a step by step article about my build once I&#8217;m done with the project.

Also, my website/MVC 3 practice/Portfolio took another turn last night. I decided I&#8217;d go lean for this project and planning to integrate it with my current wordpress blog. Started a proof of concept for and successfully queried posts from my blog. Now the real work starts: I&#8217;ll be tearing down the current design which communicates to my database. Oh well ,  I&#8217;m still waiting for my friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/emanbaniqued" target="_blank">BunnyKid</a> to finish my mascot/character illustration so I can&#8217;t release it just yet. I&#8217;ve been planning to release the said page and upgrade it with small iterations, gradually completing features one at a time.

Didn&#8217;t have the time to go to the gym today though and it&#8217;s already been almost a week since my last workout session. Boo. Midhshift really isn&#8217;t as ideal as regular shift when it comes with accomplishing a lot of things with my life. Lol.
