If you have been playing Magic 2014 Duels of the Planeswalkers (or even with the 2013 version) you know that to fully unlock a deck, you have to win 30 times for each deck (unlock 1 card at a time) or pay $0.99 for each deck you want to unlock instantly. I&#8217;d rather battle (and enjoy) for all those unlockable cards than pay money for them. But grinding will be less frustrating if you can go through each battle in the shortest possible amount of time. So I experimented with some modes up to the revenge campaign and found one opponent where you can easily defeat (at least for most of the decks):

> Go to Single player > Campaign > Innistrad and select the Skirsdag Cultists (2nd icon from the left)

Why this deck? Simple: because it only has one win condition and that is to cast 6 <a href="http://www.magicspoiler.com/mtg-spoiler/shadowborn-apostle/" target="_blank">Shadownborn Apostles</a> then sacrifices the 6 to search for the single Shadowborn Demon in the deck. So un-interrupted, the sequence will be like this:

<p style="display: inline; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.magicspoiler.com/mtg-spoiler/shadowborn-apostle/"><img alt="" src="http://www.magicspoiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Shadowborn-Apostle-M14-Visual-Spoiler.jpg" height="300" /></a><a href="http://www.magicspoiler.com/mtg-spoiler/shadowborn-demon/"><img alt="Shadowborn Demon" src="http://www.magicspoiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Shadowborn-Demon-M14-Visual-Spoiler.jpg" height="300" /></a>
</p>

Turn 1: Plays swamp, casts 1 Shadowborn Apostle

Turn 2: Plays swamp, (if there are no defenders, attacks with able creatures) casts 2 Shadowborn Apostle

Turn 3: Plays swamp, (if there are no defenders, attacks with able creatures) casts 2 Shadowborn Apostle

Turn 4: Plays swamp, (if there are no defenders, attacks with able creatures) casts 1 <a href="http://www.magicspoiler.com/mtg-spoiler/shadowborn-apostle/" target="_blank">Shadowborn Apostle</a> then sacrifices all 6 to search for a Shadowborn Demon.

Now this might sound bad but it actually isn&#8217;t. Why? Because all you have to do kill/exile/unsummon that demon and the game is in your hands. Plus the fact that the deck only has 4 swamps, 1 demon and the rest of the slots are filled with <a href="http://www.magicspoiler.com/mtg-spoiler/shadowborn-apostle/" target="_blank">Shadowborn Apostles</a>. Meaning once you take care of the big guy, everything will be as easy as pie.

Before we start, I will be assuming that you will be using these decks with 0/30 cards unlocked. Also, I will be referring to the enemy&#8217;s key card Shadowborn Demon simply as &#8220;it&#8221;. I will talk about these decks with the same order as to the order of what I think are the fastest/easiest to slowest/hardest to win with. Here are my strategies and thoughts for the decks:

**Avacyn&#8217;s Glory Deck (W)**

Key cards: <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370408" target="_blank">Path to Exile</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=368496" target="_blank">Fiend Hunter</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=259711" target="_blank">Oblivion Ring</a>.

This deck focuses on small Human creatures and their interactions with each other. Any of these 3 cards will seal the game for you, you can easily win the game by turn 6-9 depending on the humans on the board (Champion of the parish, Call to arms, ). This is the first deck I&#8217;ve completed 30 cards with, not to mention completed many of the unlockables with.

### Guardians of Light (W)

Key cards: <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=259712" target="_blank">Pacifism</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=44311" target="_blank">Dawn Elemental</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=275265" target="_blank">Spirit Mantle</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=204997" target="_blank">Armored Ascension</a>.

This deck has awesome card synergy with its cool creatures and auras. Pacifism is a 2 drop that can shut it down permanently, Dawn Elemental can take its attacks all day and all those auras can help you build the perfect flying kitten (lol) to decimate your opponent.

</p>

### Mind Maze Deck (U)

Key cards: <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=204997" target="_blank">Unsummon</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=235601" target="_blank">Claustrophobia</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=265403" target="_blank">Cancel</a>

Once bounced, the enemy can&#8217;t hard cast it because of the lack of mana. If that doesn&#8217;t work, you can lock or just counter it. After that, flood the board with happy flying illusions.

### Sliver Hive (WRG)

Key card: <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370408" target="_blank">Path to Exile</a>

Just remove it by turn 4 and then proceed beating em up with sliver power! My only concern with this is the complex mana base which makes it a little bit slower than the previously stated decks.

### Deadwalkers (B)

Key card: <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=205367" target="_blank">Cruel Revival</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=210139" target="_blank">Tendrils of corruption</a>

Oh, If only doom blade could kill black creatures this deck would be so much faster. At least building an army is easy with this deck. After killing it, let the undead roll out!

### Chant of the Mul Daya (G)

Key card: <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=193658" target="_blank">All is Dust</a>

7 mana by turn 4/5? Its very possible with all the mana acceleration this deck has. After that, just cast all the Eldrazi you have with you.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_1639.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-826" alt="IMG_1639" src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_1639-1024x768.png" width="450" height="338" /></a>
</p>

**Hunter&#8217;s Strength**

Key cards: <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=278254" target="_blank">Gloomwidow</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=249681" target="_blank">Sentinel spider</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=189922" target="_blank">Oakenform</a>

The cards stated above is just for defense against it, but the goal with this deck is to swarm the with big furry creatures.

**Masks of Dimir (UB)**

****Key cards: <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=84507" target="_blank">Time Ebb</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370550" target="_blank">Vedalken Dismisser</a>

Another one with the bounce approach but with bigger casting costs. You may sacrifice a few creatures just to block its attack or just take 10 damage before sealing its fate. After this you can use Mind Rot, Ravenous Rats to discard it then cast Beacon of Unrest to control the creature.

**Enter the Dracomancer (BRG)**

Key cards: <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=243471" target="_blank">Dragonspeaker Shaman</a>

Straighten up your mana base, cast this shaman and summ on larger dragons than the imminent threat. Harder to pull off than the other strategies the decks have to offer but at least by the time you summon those fatties they can&#8217;t even touch you.

**Firewave (R)**

Key Cards: <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=249684" target="_blank">Searing Spear</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=240013" target="_blank">Pillar of Flame</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220298" target="_blank">Chandra&#8217;s Phoenix</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=259219" target="_blank">Flames of the Firebrand</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=226585" target="_blank">Chandra&#8217;s Outrage</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=208003" target="_blank">Magma Phoenix</a>.

Its possible to nuke the guy using these but I you have no choice but to just swarm it with lots of creatures. The hardest and slowest deck to win this match with. I have no clear cut strategy with winning with this deck right from the start.

There, thats all I have right now. How about you? Do you have any other strategies for this game? Hit the comments section below! <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
