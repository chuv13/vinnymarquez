Are you one of those people who love discounts? Or are you an apple user who is reluctant buyer when it comes to iOS applications? Well, I think I have the app just for you! Introducing the <a title="AppShopper" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appshopper/id387037496?mt=8" target="_blank">AppShopper</a> for the iPad! Lol, did you just read that using the &#8216;infomercial&#8217; tone?

Anyways, back to the app. What it does is basically scout the App store for price changes. You can sort by popularity, recently uploaded or top 200. But my favorite feature is the &#8216;My Wishlist&#8217; sction. The application will then notify you (if you enable notifications) of any price changes in your wishlist. For example, I added <a title="SketchBook Pro for iPad" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sketchbook-pro-for-ipad/id364253478?mt=8" target="_blank">SketchBook Pro HD</a> for the iPad and waited patiently for a notification. A few weeks later the app notified me that the price was lowered to $1.99. A few minutes more and I got a copy of the said application.

I found lots of free utilities/games through this app and I personally recommend it for those bargain hunters out there! Happy shopping! <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
