<span class="dropcap1">F</span>or me, having stripped down versions of articles that I&#8217;ve read or want to read on the iPad is a big perk. So I tried out Pocket, Readbility and Instapaper.

Last year I installed Pocket (formerly Read it Later) because Instapaper was a paid app for iOS. I was using it for a while until I encountered 2 websites that it couldn&#8217;t render properly but Instapaper could (if you really must know, one was a game guide from playdota.com and the other was from menshealth.com). Even though I loved Pocket&#8217;s look and feel, I had no choice at the time but to ask Mawie to buy me Instapaper for iPad. Lol. I was happy with Instapaper, it served its purpose on the iPad. But not having an OSX client is a big downer for me. I want to be able to reference articles from my mac when I&#8217;m blogging, resarching or just want to read on a bigger screen.

Recently I decided to try Pocket&#8217;s new (to me) OSX client and I find it very nice indeed. Even the web app is much more refreshing in terms of the look and feel compared to Instapaper. A bit of a problem though, it still renders those 2 pages that I saved a while back the same way it did a year ago.

<a href="http://getpocket.com" target="_blank">GetPocket.com</a> recommends testing it against instapaper and even has a section for importing entries from the latter. Well, I am comparing right now and Pocket is still winning in my books.

For now I&#8217;ll use both, report the broken page translation stuff and when they finally fix that, I&#8217;m moving.
