I've recently deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts in an effort to "clean up" my shit and adopt a minimalist lifestyle.

Why? I just came a point where I didn't see much value in spending time on these Social Media platforms. It all seems so fake to me.

I've been thinking about it for a while, and I became totally convinced it was time to quit after reading a few articles and watching some videos.

In retrospect, here are the key points that led me to believe that Social Media has corrupted my life.

### Selfie-shness & Self-gratification

I used to take photos because I loved to. When I go to new places, I used to want to immortalize my time at special places by taking snaps of what I wanted to remember. Sort of like capturing important moments, you know, the way photographs were designed to be.

Later on, my photos started to prioritize my face over the background. The typical selfie. I asked myself why? The beach doesn't need my face in order for it to be beautiful. It was then that I realized I was taking pictures for the sake of posting on social media.

Did I enjoy taking all those pictures or was it just a subconscious want to exchange them for all of those fb/ig reactions?

### Addiction
Did you know that the same key ingredient found in slot machines is the very same one that is getting you addicted to keep checking your facebook/IG notifications?

+ Do you find yourself constantly checking your phone to see if somebody reacted to one of your posts?
+ Do you scroll your feed endlessly?
+ After yo watch a video, you see something interesting and click next until you realize it's 2am in the morning already?

Yeah, read up on "Intermittent Variable Rewards". We're playing a social media slot machine. Our brains have been hijacked, we're on digital coccaine peeps! Either we didn't know or we just don't care.

Even now as I am coding this site and writing this post, I'm keeping my self in check by being conscious of my original intention of returning to blogging.


### Toxicity, peenoise city

It all just became so toxic for me. My feed felt like it was a sea of bullshit complete with tidal waves, krakens, pirates, and all that stuff.

Cringe-worthy relationship posts, subjective political (discussions), vague statuses, vacation selfies (x100000), shit posting, those were what we deal with everyday. Well, you might still be dealing with those until now.

Back then, I chose to brush it off because "I had to connect" with people.

## The solution

Since I can't be a hermit and people should still be able to reach me whenever they need to, I should be atleast be able to talk with them in some way. So I chose to maintain a myriad of chat apps like Viber, Telegram, SMS.

A week before deleting my accounts, I announced on Facebook that I'd be quitting and I basically asked for contact details of those friends who are still intereseted to connect with me outside fb/ig. 

After that, I downloaded my data from facebook: A whopping 6gb of images, videos, etc. Then deleted both accounts.

### The result

I fuckin' love it! Communication is more personal as well as intentional. Whenever I have a notification, I know it's from someone that I frequently engage in meaningful conversations.

There are a times that I found it hard to find because I don't have messenger. But I take it as it is. They're not interested to connect with me, so that's that.

So if you are interested, <a href="/about">reach out to me</a>. Or if we bump into one another in the real world, let's go for a cup coffee... or better yet, a bottle of beer.
