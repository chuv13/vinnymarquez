This will be my first post for the &#8220;Fan Series&#8221; of interviews. Focusing on the fans that help their respective &#8220;scenes&#8221; work. I just want to focus on them as much as the bands they help out. My first subject is Tom or Bloodytom. Who is he? Oh just an old friend  who happens to be one of the oldest people (*cough) in the history of  The Colony. Lol. (sorry bro, peace!)

<!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?-->

**Me:** Kindly introduce yourself.

**Tom:** Hi, I&#8217;m Tom. Just Tom. I&#8217;m more commonly known as bloodytom.

**Me:** What got you into music?

**Tom:** Music itself. It can touch my emotions in a way that I cannot explain. I let this unexplainable phenomenon remain so because I always want to be surprised by how a particular song or type of music will get to me.

**Me: **Influences? Musical heroes?

**Tom:** Linus of Hollywood &#8211; One of my most respected musicians since I was a little kid  
Fuseboxx &#8211; They are one of my biggest inspirations, a huge influence to the bright future of OPM. They also opened my eyes and ears and mind to a whole new appreciation for music.!  
Ludwig van Beethoven &#8211; need I say more?  
And the great bands that I&#8217;ve listened to since I was a kid.

**Me:** Genres you listen to?

**Tom:** Pop, rock, classical, metal, progressive, punk, fusion, jazz

**Me:** What are the bands that you support (if any) and how?

**Tom:** I support many artists here and abroad but I support all prog bands in the Philippines in particular. I created and maintain (on my free time) a website for the Pinoy Prog Community. I also manage the PPC facebook account.

**Me:** Why?

**Tom:** Because these bands have incredible talents that I can&#8217;t see in mainstream acts. I feel disappointed that they are unknown to a lot of Filipino rock music fans. They are more appreciated and respected in other countries and I think its embarrassing that such level of talent is not known to young Pinoys. These are homegrown talents and I want more people to hear them.

**Me:** What do you think of the movie Almost Famous?

**Tom:** I&#8217;ve seen it a long time ago so the details are quite blurry but I like the main character for wanting to see, experience and report how it really is in the music industry. It&#8217;s not always about the fame and glory.

**Me:** Name a gadget or gadgets you can&#8217;t possibly live without when going to gigs or supporting musicians (if you have a utility belt, you are welcome to share).

**Tom:** None.

**Me:** Funniest memory while you were out there in gigs (or anything related)?

**Tom:** I can&#8217;t recall the funniest in particular but I always enjoy small gigs where my favorite local bands play and they can joke and make fun of each other as well as have fun onstage.

**Me:** Scariest?

**Tom:** Large music festivals are always scary because of the potential for losing valuables, getting mauled in the crowd, you name it; but they&#8217;re also the most exciting. I enjoy joining the mosh pit even if I get bruised. I also got in a fight one time with someone who was harassing girls in the crowd but I literally kicked the guy&#8217;s ass so it was overall a great night.

**Me:** Happiest?

**Tom:** Whenever I get to hang out with my favorite local bands pre- or post-gig.

**Me:** What do you think of the state of the local music industry?

**Tom:** Honestly, it&#8217;s quite disappointing. I may speak a little strongly when I say it but I find most of the mainstream acts to be a travesty to OPM and music itself. In spite of that, I applaud the bands and individuals that exert effort to keep the quality of OPM to something that is enjoyable and something to be proud of.

**Me:** What about the local indie movement?

**Tom:** I think they&#8217;re mostly the ones that truly want to keep the quality of OPM high. They are not pressured by any corporate management with anything and this freedom allows them to create music for the sake of music. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not implying that indie bands are automatically better but I think that a lot of indie bands deserve the support that many overrated mainstream acts are enjoying. With enough and continuous support from Filipinos, I don&#8217;t see how these talented musicians can reach a bigger audience and be more prominent than the crap that&#8217;s infesting the airwaves.

**Me:** If you could be the author a song from your favorite local band, what would it be and why?

**Tom:** While I enjoy fun songs that lighten up the mood, I have a special liking for songs that raise awareness, question authority, and challenge normally accepted norms and ideas. It makes the listeners think.

**Me:** Rush (finally) recently got inducted to the Rock and Roll hall of fame after years of being &#8216;in their own stream&#8217;. How do you think fan support has contributed to their success?

**Tom:** I think the support from their fans contributed greatly to it. While I may believe that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is affected by its own politics, the immense support of the fans was a major factor. I mean they voted and everything.

**Me:** Did you vote? Because I didn&#8217;t. Lol.

Me neither.

**Me:** This is the end of the interview, anything more you would like to say? (Promote stuff here :p)

Thanks man! Hats off to you!  Err, I just realised that this is the first time that I had an interview that didn&#8217;t require translation. (not that the previous interviewees were less filled with substance and character, they are all equally good and insightful. I actually encourage them to write how they naturally do it)
