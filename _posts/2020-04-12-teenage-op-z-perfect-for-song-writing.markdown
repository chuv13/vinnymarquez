I recently got into producing and/or performing electronic music. I started from scratch, threw away what I know about music, and I let my chosen genre(s), yeah, Progressive, Metal, Jazz, Fusion, Core, etc. take a back seat. I went full tilt towards lo-fi, trip-hop, trap-metal, and other related genres. I started to (and still) study Ableton Live and to create electronic music. I must say I'm in totally over my head, but I'm in too deep as well.

But one thing that helped me transition a bit easier was a device called the 'OP-Z' from Teenage Engineering.

## WHAT THE HELL IS AN OP-Z, YOU SAY?

Well, from the teenage engineering site:
> OPâ€“Z is an advanced fully portable 16-track sequencer and synthesizer, with a range of both sample based and synthesis based sounds.

But more than that, it's a great tool for WRITING AND FINISHING SONGS. With the availability of computers equipped with DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), it's refreshing to be able to write/perform songs with a tactile, small-form-factor instrument without bringing along a computer.

### WHAT'S GOOD?
OKAY, SO WHAT MAKES IT PERFECT THEN? Here are a number of reasons why I think they're so great! 

### PORTABLE
Well, for starters, it's so compact that I can bring it with me everyday! Because it's so small, I can write whenever, wherever I want. You see, all I need is the device plus a set of earphones and I'm all set!

There are a lot of times when I've asked my wife for a couple of minutes of "Me time" when we're on the go. I do this to tune-out all the unecessary stuff and focus on the song that's playing in my head. I've done it on the bus, on the cab, while waiting at a mall bench, at the smoking area, while shitting, you get the idea.

Previously, I had to hum the melody,drums, or whatever sequence to a voice recorder app. I had to wait to get home to finally get started on ideas that came to me while I was out of the house or away from my PC.

### POWERFUL
There's just so much technology crammed into a small package. Here, take a look at the specs:

Sequencer
- 16-track component based step sequencer. 8 audio, 8 fx/midi/tape/cv/etc. 
- 14 Step componments
- Automation <3

Sounds
- 16 sample packs, 24 samples each. You can also record or import your own.
- 12 synthesis based sound engines.
- 2 separate fx buses with delay, reverb, bit-crush, and distortion. Future firmware updates will include more fx.

Live performance
- Sequence audio, trigger iamges, 3d graphics, and DMX lights.
- Unity 3D integration.

Connectivity
- USB-C
- 3.5mm TRRS for audio or Pocket Operator Connectivity
- Bluetooth for connecting mobile as a screen.
- (optional) oplab module for CV, Pocket Operator, & MIDI

### PREMIUM FEELS
Looks tough, feels tough, with minimalist an industrial feel to it. Even the cable that come with it is nice!

On a side note, my unit has one button with a defect. I'm quite happy to report that's purely aesthetic though.

## NOT SO GOOD?
"But you said perfect.." shut it, you little sh*t. When I say perfect, I meant for song writing. It does have shortcomings, but they don't hinder the tool from achieving the purpose. Here are some reasons that I can think of.

### Availability
Unavailable locally in the Philippines. As far as I know, there is no local distributor for Teenage Engineering. Please, somebody pick this up? With that in mind, this compounds with another problem...

### PRICE
It's (a bit expensive) at around 599 USD. Add that to shipping & taxes. Ugh. Maybe, you can wait for Black Friday and get a discount if they offer any promos.

### GIG READY?
I haven't really tried but I feel you have to have some kind of controller for it be easier to use in a gig setting. A mixer would also be nice.
 
### CONNECTIVITY
Although you can connect to a lot of MIDI controllers via USB, you kind of need a something to power them or it will draind the op-z's battery.

The only logical solution would be a powered USB hub. What sucks is that there is only 1 sure USB hub that woks with it, and that's the Kingston Nucleum. So yeah, I also had to order that separately.

## FINAL THOUGHTS
It might not be for everyone, but the utility of the thing is just amazing.

I think the main thing that makes the OP-Z such a perfect instrument is that you can have something so powerful that you can fit in your pocket. You can layout or even finish creating your music anytime, anywhere.
