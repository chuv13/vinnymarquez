There are a lot more games on sale, I just listed some of the items that caught my eye. (Buying items also gives you a chance to earn Steam virtual cards so that you can craft badges, in this case the Summer Getaway badge.)

If you're a gamer and you still aren't on Steam, this might be a good time to jump right in. Or if you're in steam just for DoTA 2, a lot of these titles are definitely worth their discounted prices.

(Disclaimer: this is not a paid advertisement of some sort, I just checked Steam last night and noticed the promos)
