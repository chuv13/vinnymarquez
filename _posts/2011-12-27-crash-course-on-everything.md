<span class="dropcap1">I</span>&#8216;m almost done with my targets for today: the sidebar of my blog containing links to posts categorized by category, tag and year/month.

Lately I&#8217;ve been keen on learning a lot of stuff. I recently apllied for 4 online courses from Stanford and Berklee; got our family friend to teach me about photography, camera tricks and his approach on taking photographs; downloaded tons of ebooks; practiced new coding stuff and trying to learn more about audio engineering and other audio related stuff.

Is that enough stuff to keep me up all night maybe for the 1st quarter of 2012? Lols. So much to do!
