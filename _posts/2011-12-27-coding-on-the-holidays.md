<span class="dropcap1">S</span>o its the holidays and I&#8217;m supposed to be on vacation right? Right! So why am I coding? Well, as my friend TJ told once told me, I have an &#8220;uncool&#8221; thing for a hobby. Lols. What&#8217;s wrong with coding for fun?

Anyway, just putting finishing touches on this blog here. Forgot to backup the database on my main machine and I have no access to it since I&#8217;m at our ancestral home. I just setup a temporary office in our sala since everyone else went to Coron, Palawan. Not me, I actually wanted to work. Lols.

So much to do! I hope I finish everything I have lined up.
