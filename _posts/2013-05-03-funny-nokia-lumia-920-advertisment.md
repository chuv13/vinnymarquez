I am a fan of Apple (their history and products) but its kind of hard for me since I&#8217;m a .net developer: its my day job. I love what MS did with WP8: you simply can&#8217;t accuse it of being a copy of any of the current players in the market (well, <a href="http://tekblurb.com/2012/05/windows-aol-image/" target="_blank">this image suggests that it copied from AOL&#8217;s 1996 site</a>) and ofcourse the fact that I can develop apps for it without a huge adjustment in skills. I&#8217;ve been wanting to switch to WP8 from iOS but still holding back because of the investment I already made (hardware AND software) and I am still waiting for it to mature to a level that I&#8217;m comfortable with (for the hardware atleast).

Anyway, this add from Nokia is hillarious and the simple message &#8220;Don&#8217;t fight. Switch.&#8221; for me is genius. Now, if I could just get one **\*cough 2013 employee techn gift \*cough** I&#8217;d be very happy. Lol.
