Most of the people I meet do not understand my job description very well. Either I get puzzled looks as I tell them my expertise or they ask me to explain the details about my skills. Sometimes, even after explaining it to them they tell me they don&#8217;t get me. Some of the people I&#8217;ve worked with before understand the need. I&#8217;ve been interviewed by a lot of companies who have no idea or worse; they think that we are not needed in a development team.

Why do we need integrators? I get questioned from both sides of the fence i.e. designers and developers. Maybe I can shed a little light into this subject.

To start off, I would like to define what an integrator&#8217;s role is and establish the need for an integrator. An integrator&#8217;s job i**s to bridge the gap between the designers and the developers, designing and coding**. An integrator has to have experience in both: with designers that means coding and with developers to make them understand the importance of usability. Some might argue that some designers can actually code. Yeah I agree some of them can code, but can they create quality code like their developer counterparts? Especially in an enterprise level application? How about developers? Some (if not most) developers despise doing UI tasks. Can we expect them to create wonderful interfaces just like their designer counterparts? Can you expect them to follow at least utilizing the grid design in their interfaces? Can you imagine the interaction between these two groups when working within a team? How can they relate to each other? I remember this funny image from� [9GAG][1]:

<div>

Lol. Sometimes this is reality, even if we refuse to acknowledge it. So what do we do? Enter the integrator! He/she can help unify the team by working with everyone, making other people understand each other and take up the tasks in� the rift between roles. After all they&#8217;re also called� **Glue Guys� **(sometimes Devigner or Developer Designer).

Here&#8217;s an example of how integrator can help consolidate team effort.� In a Silverlight project:

<div>
  Product Owner asks for features. BA churn out requirements. Designer creates design for screens. If the said designer can use Blend then the prototyping can involve BAs, then designer prototypes alongside the integrator who can possibly give advice on what are the possibilities and limitations of the platform. If designer cannot use Blend the integrator can convert said design to a Blend prototype (Sketchflow) himself. Lets say prototyping is over and the next step is implementation. Integrator implements the design. The whole time the process above happens, the developers have been busy creating the backend stuff like databases, data layer, services and whatnot. So by this time the integrator then can consume services while implementing functionality in the ViewModel. Rinse, repeat.
</div>

For me, bringing artsy people together with pragmatic logical people is fun but at times it can get really hectic (and you learn a lot of stuff too!).

<div>
  So I hope I this article helped you understand what an integrator&#8217;s role is.� So the next time you encounter an integrator, be nice, give them a hug and tell them they are needed. Lol. <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
