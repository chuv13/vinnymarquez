Yes! Finally! Today is the day I officially launch my site! Whew! I had to do a lot of stuff before finally sharing it to the public. Many thanks to Mawie for always giving me advice and acting as my QA and also to all my friends who have been so generous with their comments regarding this (those whom I secretly shared it with). This is of course a work in progress, so I will do my best to add more functionality to the site.

Welcome to the initial release [johnvinnymarquez.net][1]!
