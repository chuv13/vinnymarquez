> By definition: Acceptance in human psychology is a person’s assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition without attempting to change it or protest it. (blatantly taken from Wikipedia).

One of the best lessons I’ve recently learned is that as humans, we can’t control anything beyond our sphere of influence. In reality, we can only control ourselves and our reactions to external factors.
By taking the definition literally it sounds like being passive but in reality, it is one of the bravest things that one could ever do.

I have found a certain kind of peace and solace in the fact that there is only so much that I can change.

**Acceptance is not resignation. It is freedom.**


Let me dive in deeper using one of my recent experiences.

I was never good at drawing. I sucked. I’m not a talented vocalist. I’ve always felt that I’ve never measured up to what I think makes a great singer. I was (and will always be) a sub-standard writer, photographer, and designer. Although my close friends beg to differ (love your own eh), the world has not been kind to me and my self expression.

Talking about all the other forms of art that I’ve dabbled in would make this a very long post, so I’m just going to focus on music.

I remember being a new member with my previous band Nimbus Crowd. Being a member of that band made me realize how a crappy (wannabe) musician I was (am). I auditioned for the vocalist position and got the part, learned their songs and gigged with them. Feeling oh so high whenever I got into stage with them. When it came down to composing songs for the group, I was lost. I tried to write but everything was forced. I could never properly express my music because of the lingering fear that I would never match their level of musicianship.

Fast forward to the present, at the time we formed Tito Science. I started adapting the ‘I don’t fucking care anymore’ mindset. I threw away the thought that my band mates are miles away from me with regards to technical music. These days, the way I contribute to the band is that I made a promise to be myself to be unapologetic, raw, and true to myself.

Whatever material I submit to the band is straight from my heart, mind, and soul. Because of this mindset, I feel that I have been freed from the shackles that I myself have willingly put on.

The result? **I have so much fun making music now. I’m actually having the time of my life**. I’m not driven by the want to show the world my skills, to get more fans, or to be well known in the music industry. All that’s in my head is that I should be able to bring out all I have in me and fulfill what I was designed for.

It’s fucking liberating I tell ya.

What I’ve just talked about can be applied to just about anything. Be it work, relationships, hobbies, whatever. You just need balls… metaphorical balls, I mean.

I have found renewed confidence in wearing my own skin, that I am me regardless of what the everyone says I am or I should be. I believe that I am to be judged by my own standards, and not the world’s.

Ah, crazy thoughts @ 4am. I’m going to stop here and sleep.
