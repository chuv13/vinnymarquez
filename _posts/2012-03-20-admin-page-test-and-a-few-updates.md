Here&#8217;s a TED video I recently watched that I&#8217;d like to share to you guys.

<span class="dropcap1">S</span>o this is a test post from my shiny new admin page. Yes, I was manually creating posts by using SQL Server. <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

So today I&#8217;m just at home resting since I just came from the hospital last night. Bad case of vomiting and other stuff. The dinner we were supposed to have last night got cancelled too (I was looking forward to eating at Barbara&#8217;s Intramuros with Mawie and her mom). <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> 

Anyways, time to rest.
