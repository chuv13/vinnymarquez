<span class="dropcap1">H</span>appy new year! After 17 days I finally had the time to write my maiden post for year 2013! Yay! not a good start. Lol. Anyway, I&#8217;m here to tell you about my new business cards from <a href="http://about.me/" target="_blank">About.me</a>� in collaboration with <a href="http://uk.moo.com/" target="_blank">Moo.com</a>.

I joined About.me� last year, a service that provides individuals a personal portal. Weeks after I decided to try and avail the free pack from their offers. What you get � is 50 pieces of the design of your choice:

> <ul class="bulleted">
>   <li>
>     We&#8217;ll add your info, your about.me URL, and a� <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" target="_blank">QR code</a>� to your cards
>   </li>
>   <li>
>     Upload additional images if you&#8217;d like – each card can<br /> be different
>   </li>
>   <li>
>     Add to or edit your contact information
>   </li>
>   <li>
>     Cover shipping costs (approx. $5.50) and your custom pack<br /> will arrive at your door
>   </li>
> </ul>

*(taken from the offers page on their site)*

The only thing that I dislike with the card is that big Moo.com logo on the lower left of my card. Well, it&#8217;s free so its fine. Thats not going to be there whan I finish my design for my \*real\* card.

Designing is a breeze using the website&#8217;s tool. Its simple, easy to understand and use:

It took around 2-3 weeks before the package arrived and I must say that I am impressed by the quality of the items. I really love the matte texture, the colors (except my logo since I don&#8217;t have experience with print media) and the thickness of the paper.

*(this are OOC jpeg and I think it does not do justice to the actual item)*

Also included in the package is a card container/box that I do not get how to assemble. Oh well, that&#8217;s what google is for:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Box thingie" alt="Box thingie" src="http://i1169.photobucket.com/albums/r511/johnvinnymarquez/P1170005_zps279d3c49.jpg" width="600" height="450" />

If you have an About.me page I recommend you try this. I do not mind paying just the shipping fee for 50 pcs of cards and unless I find something better locally, I&#8217;m going to source my real business cards from Moo.com.

Go on, try it! Enjoy!
