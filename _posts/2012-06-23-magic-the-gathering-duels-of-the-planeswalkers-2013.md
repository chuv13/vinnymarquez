  <a title="M2013" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magic-2013/id502588466?mt=8">Magic The Gathering: Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013</a>. The game I&#8217;ve been waiting for has been released for the iPad! It&#8217;s the successor to Duel of the Planeswalkers 2012 (because 2013 comes after 2012. Lol) but also released for the iPad.
</p>

Modes:  
Campaign &#8211; Has 4 modes Campaign, Revenge, Planechase and Challenges  
Multiplayer &#8211; Free-for-all and Planechase  
Custom Game &#8211; Two-headed Giant, Free-for-all and Planechase

<p class="p1">
  The campaign basically takes you across the planes going through other planeswalkers. You start from Shandalar and work your way to Innistrad, Ravnica and Alara while you batle familiar faces like Jace, Chandra, and Lilliana. The game has 10 unlockable decks*, freebies (like aspecial magic 2013 booster pack**) and other unlockable stuff.

  I find the game very nice for the price (<a title="View in iTunes" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magic-2013/id502588466?mt=8" target="_blank">$9.99</a>) and find it very enjoyable. I&#8217;ve been in and out of playing MTG and because of this my love for the game has been rekindled.� I&#8217;ve been able to finish the campaign in about a day in easy mode but to a bug my progress has been wiped out.***

  What I think makes it a great game:<br /> Very nice and easy to learn for beginners because of the tutorial and the tool tips<br /> Very nice user experience<br /> Cool art, graphics implementation and animations
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Not so good stuff:<br /> Sometimes dragging, dropping and clicking is a hassle. Then again you can live with it.<br /> My game progress got erased, what&#8217;s up with that?
</p>

<p class="p1">
  What I think would make it better:<br /> I wish they had support for all blocks, or atleast some other block, not just m2013<br /> It would have been nice if we could totally edit the decks, i.e. win/buy cards not just unlocking them.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <strong>EDIT: 7/4/2012</strong><br /> <strong>Wizards customer help replied and thanked me for reporting the bug (the game wiped my progress), I also recommended for iCloud use. But as of now, still no update. I find that if my game center is disconnected it reverts to an old version of my progress. All I do now when that happends is to close the app and wait for gamecenter to kick in.� </strong>

  * The decks can be automatically unlocked for $0.99 each.<br /> ** If you are from the Philippines we cannot claim yet because there are no participating stores yet for our country. How did I know? I emailed support and they told me to email� <a href="mailto:apac@wizards.com"><span class="s1">apac@wizards.com</span></a>. Still waiting for their response.<br /> *** Pending question to wizards customer help
