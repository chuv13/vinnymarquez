I just read about <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/02/19/hidden-facebook-feature-death/" target="_blank">an article on Mashable about a mother infuriated with the police for notyfing her through Facebook of her son&#8217;s death</a>. Aparently, there&#8217;s a feature in Facebook messages from people not connected to the user are placed in a folder called the &#8216;other&#8217; section. For messages to be &#8216;sure&#8217; to appear on the inbox, <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/facebook-1-dollar-private-inbox-messages/" target="_blank">the sender will have to pay $1</a>. This section looks like a grayed out tab next to the inbox label.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Facebook 'other' section" alt="Facebook 'other' section" src="http://i1169.photobucket.com/albums/r511/johnvinnymarquez/ScreenShot2013-02-20at114822PM_zps949e1f7f.png" width="331" height="463" />

I just realized that I am one of the people that (as the articles suggests) do not know about this said feature and I&#8217;ve been missing out on messages since 11/11/2007 (first message I saw in the said section). I skimmed the section and found a lot of legitimate offers, people who I think really knew me and even opportunities. Oh well&#8230; to those people that I could have replied to, I am sorry, I just found out about the feature.

How about you guys? How many of you knew of these features ealier? Any missed opportunities? Comments are appreciated.
