I have to admit, its only been my 2nd time to go to UP and at both times I attended a photography seminar. My interest for photography (I chose the word &#8216;interest&#8217; meaning it still hasn&#8217;t evolved to passion) was renewed when the micro four thirds platform finally became mature. As stated in <a href="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/blog/2013/01/19/olympus-omd-em-5" target="_blank">my previous post</a>, I was taught to shoot film when I was very young but ended up forgeting all about it. Anyway, my gf got me a link  (she&#8217;s a very good researcher BTW) to <a href="http://sirnicolay.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">SirNicolay&#8217;s site</a> and reviews regarding his photography workshops which were instrumental in taking on the whole course with my brother (my graduation gift).

We&#8217;re on our 2nd week (3rd workshop), we&#8217;ve done Basic Digital Photography and Natural Editing last week. Last saturday we did Black and white (HDR class was cancelled and we didn&#8217;t get the chance to). So he explained tips and techniques for B&W photography, then set us out in the field to shoot. There&#8217;s something really fun going around the streets, aimlessly wandering and wondering what it has in store for you. It was extra fun going around UP and appreciating the new screnery (well, new for me). Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like other types of photography like Portraits, Concert and Landscape but my heart is set on street photography. I remember seeing Henry Cartier-Bresson images when I was young, awe-struck and amazed at the wonderful photgraphs.

Anyway, back to SirNicolay&#8217;s class. He&#8217;s a good teacher and photographer. I like the fact that he is very good with imparting knowledge. I know a little about photography but most of these information are jumbled stuff from reading online material, peer inputs and trial and error. I like the way he teaches because it brings together everything I&#8217;ve read/experienced so far into one consolidated and meaningful package. I&#8217;m looking forward to that street photography class, which is at the end of the whole course. I also think that its cool that he limits his classes to 8 students at a time and sticks to it (the last portraiture class that we planned to crash already had 7 students so we couldn&#8217;t join because 7 + 2 = 9 which is > 8. Thank you Captain Obvious).

If you are starting out with photography I really recommend his classes (again, this is not a paid advertisment. I just like to blog about good products/services). You can <a href="http://sirnicolay.blogspot.com/p/photography-courses.html" target="_blank">view all the courses available</a> and<a href="http://sirnicolay.blogspot.com/p/schedule-of-classes.html" target="_blank"> the current schedules</a>.

As a bonus, here are the snaps that I took for class (lol):
