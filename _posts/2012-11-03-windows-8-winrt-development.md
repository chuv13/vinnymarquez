I haven&#8217;t been able to blog recently because I&#8217;ve been so busy with a lot of stuff the past months doing mostly WinRT application development. Our company <a href="http://magenic.com/Locations/ManilaInternationalOffice.aspx" target="_blank">Magenic Manila</a> (Rivereo Inc., a subsidiary of <a title="http://magenic.com/" href="http://magenic.com/" target="_blank">Magenic</a>) started an internal contest (and I hear <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/" target="_blank">Rocky Lohtka</a> himself will be one of the judges! Sweet!). In short a brief stint in product development (at last). I am practically still a newbie with regards to WinRT but the experience I had with Silverlight/WPF development allowed for an easy transition. As of this moment, here is my report regarding WinRT:

**Very easy to transition into, coming from a SL/WPF background**. XAML, my favorite markup language is pretty much the same in this platform (that can be good or bad depending on how you look at it).

**Lighter Requirements.** Compared to previous previous the other OSes, I find it more efficient in the &#8216;features that you get compared to the hardware required&#8217; aspect. For around 2 months I just installed the RTM version using parallels (on a MacBook Pro Mid 2010). Alloted 4GB memory for the instance. Though not as fast as I wanted I could still use dual monitors. *I haven&#8217;t bought a license though, I still don&#8217;t have a Windows box for now*.

**Hurray for new controls**. Well, new for me. Having no real experience whatsoever with WP7/7.5. I had fun with GridView and other controls. Also, I found out some of my custom controls have been rendered useless now (atleast some just require modification in order to fit the &#8216;Metro Style Guidelines&#8217;). I like Metro Style because the &#8216;grid&#8217; style/concept is all I am currently capable of (for now). Lol.

**HTML5/CSS3/C++ support**. Yeah, nice move MS! Well, not as beneficial to me since I&#8217;m more of a XAML person now than HTML but for web devs, this is great news. Oh and did I mention Direct3D support?

Thats all I have right now, I&#8217;ve barely scratched the Surface (get it? lol). So one of my short term goals is to acquire a dev machine (a mini-itx rig), get a Windows 8 and Visual Studio 2012 + Expression Blend. My wallet is going to die again.

On a side note, I would like my dev team <a href="http://ftlwerkz.com/" target="_blank">FTLWerkz</a> to start doing projects on WinRT since I think the cost for development in this platform is significantly lower. Practice makes perfect.
