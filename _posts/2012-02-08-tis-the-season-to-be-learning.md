Lately, I&#8217;ve been busy developing the administration part of my site, especially integrating my users with OpenId. I&#8217;ve found a very nice solution (one that will keep my headaches at bay) in the form of� <a title="Janrain Engage" href="http://www.janrain.com/products/engage" target="_blank">Janrain Engage</a>� (ex-Rpx?). Once I&#8217;m done with my implementation maybe I&#8217;ll find the time to share my experiences. Maybe.

During my adventures with ASP.net MVC development, I learned (and still learning) so much about the current trends in web development and I&#8217;m beginning to fall in love all over again. I&#8217;ve shunned ASP.net when silverlight came out, and I think its about time I came back. While reading a lot of articles regarding my Web dev, an article from JohnPapa about the� <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">Knockout.js</a>� plugin piqued my interest. Its basically a framework that will let you implement the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern into your view. Will I be able to use my skills from Silverlight? Can&#8217;t wait to study this one!

In another galaxy far far away, I&#8217;ve been trying to improve my songwriting skills. I finished 2 instrumentals (their still in my head) and as soon as I finish some of my tasks I&#8217;ll start laying out the drum tracks and then start on the songs.

It&#8217;s been a while since I had this much fun learning!
