  <em>I&#8217;m currently experimenting with new sections/article types for my blog and one of my initial ideas was to interview interesting people (interesting for me).� </em><em>For my pilot post, the first person who came into mind was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/darkcrayolaband/" target="_blank">Dark Crayola</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/juwanfidle09" target="_blank">Fidel De Jesus</a>. For some reason, once you meet the guy (and experience his wackiness and playing style! Style and tone!) there&#8217;s a very high chance you won&#8217;t be forgetting him in the near future (plus the fact that I always see posts from him on my facebook/youtube feed, he has quite a good grasp of social networking dynamics). He is Outspoken, funny and witty. Anyways, he&#8217;s (first and foremost) one of the guitarists, vocalist and composer for Dark Crayola. He is also a GraphTech, NekoGuitars and Wampler Pedals endorser. So I hunted him down (using my mouse) and asked for an interview (of sorts. Well, I sent him questions and he sent me back answers. those count right?) and this is what I got:� </em>

</p>

**Your live setup?**  
**F:**� Guitar -> Wampler Triple Wreck -> Amp  
I&#8217;m a minimalist kinda guy. (tamad lang magsetup&#8230;)� *[or just too lazy to setup]*

**Your recording setup?**  
**F:� **Guitar -> Line6 TonePort GX� -> Laptop

**We grew up in the pre-internet era. Was it more difficult to learn musical stuff then than now? If yes, would you consider beginner musicians of today more fortunate because of technologies available?� **

**F:**� Oo, naaalala ko pa dati na kailangan ko pang pumunta ng music store para bumili ng tabs. Kung magpapaturo ka ng gitara, kailangan mo talaga maghanap ng magtuturo sayo (pupunta sa gigs o kokontakin in person). Though, ok pa din na dumaan ako sa ganung era kasi natutunan ko maging resourceful at magbigay ng value sa practice time ko.� *[Yes, I remember back in my day we had to go to music stores to purchase tabs. If you wanted to learn guitar you had to find a teacher by going to gigs. Though I'm still ok with the fact that I went through that era because I learned to be resourceful and learned to value my practice time]*

Ngayon kasi, isang click mo lang nandyan na lahat ng kailangan mo.� *[These days a mouse click will get you what you need]*

**How did technology change/influence your musical journey so far?**  
**F:**� Promoting or sharing materials is really easy now and there are lots and lots of free downloadable programs/plugins out there for the self produced recording artist.

Madali na magproduce ng sariling material ngayon. Computer lang talaga ang puhunan.� *[Its easy to produce your own material these days. A computer is what you should relaly invest in]*

**How do you take advantage of social networks?**  
**F:**� Post, post, post, plug, plug, plug! Ganun talaga e, pero not to the point na parang spam na. Ibang usapan na yun. I really believe that if there people who really support you, they&#8217;ll always check you or your band for updates.� *[Post, post, post, plug, plug, plug! That's just how it is, but not to the point of spamming. That would be different. I really believe that if there people who really support you, they'll always check you or your band for updates.]*

**Are you optimistic for the future of music?**  
**F:**� Yeah! It&#8217;s constantly evolving right now. I think it&#8217;s good sign because genres/subgenres are fused together along with technology to create something new and fresh.

**Thoughts on the local music scene?**  
**F:**� Leveled na yung playing field ngayon, di lang kasi TV, radyo, dyaryo at magazines yung source ng media. Alam na ng mga tao kung sino ang nagpproduce ng materials na may laman at sense, regardless of genre. Thank you internet!� *[We're on a leveled playing field now: we are no longer limited to TV, radio, newpapers and magazines for our sources of media. Nowadays, people know who produces material with depth and sense, regardless of genre. Thank you internet!]*

**If you were given a chance to build you dream guitar (money is no object), what would the specs be?**  
**F:**� (guitar geek mode)

Walnut top, book matched  
Oil finish

**Its election campaign time in the Philippines. If you were tasked to create a campaign jingle for a candidate, what song would you use for base?**

**F:**� It really depends on what the candidate wants *(oh, I was expecting a mashup of Gangnam Style/Gwiyomi/Pantera/Backstreet Boys)*

****This will be the end of the interview.� **Thanks for the opportunity Sir. Anything else that you&#8217;d like people to know about?� **
