Since migrating to Orchard MCS, my blogging life has been much easier, compared to the old hand coded website I had I have fewer head aches now. And with the features this new platform has I decided to divide my site into 4 sections (technically, into 4 blogs):

<div>
  /Blog &#8211; My personal blog or where I put things that don&#8217;t really fit into the other categories
</div>

<div>
  /Tech &#8211; All about technology
</div>

<div>
  /Music &#8211; My posts regarding the music that I love
</div>

<div>
  /Photography &#8211; My adventures in learning how to capture light
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Now my posts, can be categorized much better. Old blogposts are still in the personal blog and I won&#8217;t be moving them for SEO reasons.

  Also, one of the features that I implemented is the facebook comments at the end of the articles. I no longer use Disqus (it was great but no one wanted to give feedback ) and decided to give facebook comments a try. I&#8217;m kind of excited with this one since everyone has their FB account open on their browsers so commenting/interacting will be alot easier compared to my previous solutions.

  Any suggestions for the site? Ideas for the posts I do? Now is the time to try and use that shiny new comments section below! <img src="http://johnvinnymarquez.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
