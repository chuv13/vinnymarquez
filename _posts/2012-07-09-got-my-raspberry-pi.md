A happy monday to everyone! (am I the only one happy on mondays? lol)

At long last! After months of waiting I finally got hold of the <a title="Raspberry Pi" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>! Yeah!

Rasberry Pi is the brainchild of Eben Upton, Rob Mullins, Jack Lang and Alan Mycroft from University of Cambridge’s Computer Laboratory. It&#8217;s a small form factor (about the size of a credit card) 700Mhz (ARM based) computer with a Videocore 4 GPU, 256mb RAM, 2 USB Ports, RCA, HDMI and starndard audio jacks. For more info head to the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Org FAQS</a>.

I just realized I wasn&#8217;t really ready for setting this up: I have a spare mouse and keboard but I don&#8217;t have a monitor and power supply. So tomorrow I&#8217;m going to head to CDRKing/ACE Hardware to find a power supply for this one. Below is an impromptu unboxing done in the pantry (while my office mates troll me in Tagalog) of our office uploaded raw on youtube.



I can&#8217;t wait to set it up! This will serve as server/torrent box/media player for my little home. It will also serve as my intro to Linux distros and maybe more inspiration for blog posts.

Anyone interested? You can get them online through <a title="RS Components" href="http://uk.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=raspberrypi" target="_blank">RS Components</a> for £21.60 (exclusive of VAT & delivery)
