I created this blog for two reasons: one is for me to have a portfolio/personal space and the other is to practice my web skills (for transitioning from Silverlight back to Web Development using ASP MVC). I built my the initial site from the ground up using MVC 3 and has been a proud owner of a totally custom-tailored website. From a software development perspective the project was a success because I have fulfilled my own requirements. From a product standpoint though, it was actually a failure. I hit the ground running with the &#8216;new&#8217; MVC version (3 at the time of the website&#8217;s development) and I got to accomplish the basic features for me to be able to write a blog post. The sad thing though is I never really got past those &#8216;basic features&#8217; and the site development stagnated for more than a year.

Last week I finally gave up and acknowledged that I do not have the time, nor resources to continue developing my infrastructure for the site and sought of a new starting point for development. Then I found <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net" target="_blank">Orchard CMS</a>: an open source site/blogging platform made from ASP MVC and other related technologies. I fell in love instantly. I researched more about it (with what little time I have left) and concluded that I want to start to develop using this platform. So today I&#8217;m saying goodbye to my old website and saying hello to this new instance of orchard for my blog. I&#8217;d like to point out though that this will not be a version 2.0 of my site yet. I will still have to slowly study and then extend this site to (especially the UI) for me to be able to call it my own. As of the moment, I have not touched a single line of code in this site. I merely configured and installed stuff that I want/need and used a ready made theme. For now that will be enough.

In memoriam, here are the screen shots of my old blog:
