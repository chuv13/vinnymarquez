#### ABOUT ME

I'm Vinny Marquez. A lot of people call me "Tito Vi", others "Basti", the rest just call me "Vinny". Pick your poison.

I’m perfectly fine living a life that others don’t understand. I don't give a flying f*ck!

Software developer by day, vocals for Tito Science by night! My interests lie in **music, cars, technology, and martial arts**.

I believe that Beer makes things better, black goes with everything, and that we're all stardust in disguise.

Works & resides in Makati, PH.

#### ABOUT THIS BLOG

Primarily because I have deleted my Social Media accounts, I created this blog to share some of my not-so-private thoughts.
